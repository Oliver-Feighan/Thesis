This repo contains all the files using for writing the thesis for
postgraduate study. This project is structured with the chapters in separate
directories, and the main `thesis.tex` file containing instructions to link other
`.tex` files together into the main `thesis.pdf` document.

### Current Layout:

- 7 chapters
    - Introduction (lit. review) chapter
    - Results 1: $\Delta$-SCF and $\Delta$-xTB
    - Results 2: chl-xTB 
    - Results 3: Exciton Framework
    - Results 4: Spectral Density of LHII
    - Discussions
    - Appendices
        - general details, such as hardware and programs used.


### Plan of Action:
1. Set layout, with sketches of figure headings
2. Add first pass of figures
    1. Add figures to positions in the chapter tex files
    2. Collate where data is in repos, and what might need rerunning/restructuring
3. Results chapters
    1. In order 
4. Discussion chapter
    1. Consider whether other data is needed for conclusion
    2. Consider overall structure for ending of the narrative
5. Introduction chapter 
    1. All topics that need to be covered should be known
    2. Review can be streamlined by knowing what will be referenced to in later
