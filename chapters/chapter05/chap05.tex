\chapter{Light Harvesting Complexes}
\label{chap:LH2}

\initial {T}his chapter reports on the application of the chl-xTB exciton framework
in calculating the spectral density of the exciton states of LH2. By comparing the
this spectral density to spectra from other systems, as well as properties such
as the Huang-Rhys factors for chlorophyll normal modes and chlorophyll separations,
it is argued that the protein scaffold has little effect on exciton states outside
of affecting individual chromophore geometries, and that intrinsic properties of
chlorophyll play a much greater part in determining the spectral density.

\section{LH2}
\label{sec:LH2}

In the introduction it was stated that spectral densities of individual sites can
be calculated with an explicit electronic treatment for each frame of a time series.

For larger systems, such as the 27-site exciton system in LH2, the increased volume
of calculation necessary mean that approximations have to be made that averages
over intra-site properties, reducing the level of deatil. Due to the efficiency
of the chl-xTB exciton method, it was possible to calculate the transition properties
for each site for each frame of a time series, and construct and diagonalise the
Frenkel exciton Hamiltonian.

This chapter tries to answer two questions about environmental frequency coupling
to the exciton states. The first is whether the is the presence of low frequency
modes in the spectral density, which would be indicative of a large scale motion
of the protein scaffold. It can be seen on AFM images of the LH2 protein that there
are distinct deformations of the circular symmetry, which would indicate a ring-
breathing mode in the chlorophyll site positions. It is not fully understood whether
this would have an effect on the exciton states. Second would be by how much is 
the exciton state spectral density different to that of the sites. This would be
an indicator of whether the protein structure promotes some special interaction 
between sites, or if the protein only affects intra-chromophore geometry. Whilst
these two questions only probe vague details of the protein structure, there are
other conclusions possible that would be useful for further studies. The amount 
of intra- verses inter-site difference would inform how much detail is needed for
future studies on LH2. It would also help in the design of artificial systems, which
is discussed later.

\subsection{Spectral Density Method}
\label{subsec:spec_dens}

The spectral density describes how the oscillations in the surrounding environment 
can effect a property. Whilst it is not limited to transition energies, it is usually
used when looking at light harvesting complexes to assign functions to the protein
structure. 

There are a several definitions of spectral density. This chapter uses the definitions
laid out by Mallus \emph{et al.} \cite{Mallus2018}. This describes the spectral density
as the real part of the Fourier transform of the classical autocorrelation function.
The autocorrelation here is the deviation of transition energies from the mean, 
correlated with itself

\begin{equation}
    C\left(t_j\right) = \frac{1}{N-j} \sum^{N-j}_{k=1} \Delta E \left(t_j + t_k\right) \left(t_k\right)
\end{equation}
%
where $j,k$ are indices in the time series, $N$ the total number of frames in the
time series, and $\Delta E$ the deviation of transition energy to the mean. The
spectral density is then given by

\begin{equation}
    J\left(\omega\right) = \frac{\beta \omega}{\pi} \int^\infty_0 dt \, C\left(t\right) \cos \left(\omega t\right)
\end{equation}
%
where $\omega$ are the frequencies and $\beta$ is the inverse temperature $\frac{1}{k_B T}$.

In practice, the spectral density is usually calculated from a discrete series of 
a property calculated from the frames of an MD simulation. Hence the autocorrelation
and Fourier transforms are also discrete. This places a limit on the frequencies 
that the spectral density can cover, proportional to both the length of the MD
for the low frequency limit and the interval between frames for the high frequency
limit. The high frequency limit is usually around 1-2 fs in order to capture all
atomic movements. The lower frequency limit is an open ended limit, dependent on
the number of frames that can be used to calculate exciton states.

\section{Calculating LH2 Excitons}
\label{sec:MD}

\subsection{Molecular Dynamics}
\label{subsec:specdens_MD}

The time series of exciton states was calculated from a series of structures of 
LH2 generated by simulations run with the OpenMM package. The forcefield and geometry
was the same as used by Ramos \emph{et al.} \cite{Mennucci2019}. For each simulation,
the system was equilibriated for 60 ps. The production workflow length was 300 ps, 
with frames taken every 2 fs similar to the work done by Mallus \emph{et al.} \cite{Mallus2018}.
A Langevin integrator set at 300 K was used with a timestep of 2 fs. Non-bonded
interactions were treated with a PME method.

\subsection{Scaling}
\label{subsec:specdens_scaling}

Exciton states were calculated with the same method as discussed in the previous 
chapter, extending beyond the dimer system to include all chlorophyll sites. The
elements in exciton Hamiltonian were calculated using chl-xTB properties. It was
necessary to implement a highly parallelised version of the code to calculate chl-xTB
properties with good scaling. It was found that using a parent program to partition
each chlorophyll site to run in serial on a single core had the best performance,
with the data then being collected back in to calculate the exciton Hamiltonian.
As the machines available had around 20 cores, the scaling of each exciton run was
similar to a single chl-xTB calculation.

The main bottleneck in calculating these states was the volume of chl-xTB properties
needed, as it was found construction and diagonlisation of the exciton Hamiltonian
was negligable. A 300 ps MD simulation, saving frames every 2 fs, generates 150,000
individual frames requiring 4,050,000 chl-xTB runs to construct the exciton Hamiltonian.
The time for each chl-xTB calculation is $\approx 1$ second, so this presents about
46 days of CPU time. This was significantly reduced by using the highly parallelised
program. Whilst have this level of detail is necessary for spectral density investigations,
other properties of the LH2 system that can be obtained with more statistical methods
may still be more efficient use of resources.

\subsection{Coupling Values}
\label{subsec:coupling_values}

A summary of the coupling values, broken down by ring-interaction type, are shown
in figure \ref{fig:coupling_all}.
The coupling values obtained from the chl-xTB exciton framework match those of previous
studies well. Coupling values are highest for B850-B850 interactions, distributed
around a centre of 350 $\text{cm}^{-1}$, which corresponds well with previously 
used values between 238 and 771 $\text{cm}^{-1}$ \cite{Cogdell2006}. Intra-dimer
(where the dimer is a subunit of LH2 chlorophylls consisting of a B850a, B850b and
B800 chlorophyll) couplings are markedly stronger than inter-dimer couplings, which
also corresponds well with previous estimated of inter-dimer couplings being ~100 
$\text{cm}^{-1}$ less than intra-dimer couplings. Inter-ring couplings are much 
lower, with distributions around 35 $\text{cm}^{-1}$ and 10 $\text{cm}^{-1}$, consistent
with previous estimates of between 24 and 31 $\text{cm}^{-1}$.

    Probability distribution of B800-B850 interactions.}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Screening and Embedding}
\label{subsec:screening}

Recent studies that calculate exciton models for light harvesting systems employ
screening factors as well as point charge interactions to compensate for some of
the embedding effects of the protein scaffold. These were also tested, but ultimately
not used for the spectral density in favour of a vacuum model.

Point charge embedding, used in the previous chapter for LH2 dimers, was again used
with the required PME periodic terms implemented with the open source \code{helPME}
library. The CPU time of the PME terms was profiled using the LH2 MD frames, and
it was found that due to implementation problems with re-using splines and grid 
positions the time for each chl-xTB calculation increased from $\approx 1$ second
to $\approx 40$ seconds. Additionally the PME functions required multiple cores 
in order to get the best performance, which competed with the site parallelisation
of serial chl-xTB runs. As improving PME implementations are out of the scope of
this work (beyond what was already done to achieve the work in the last chapter),
and considering that the embedding only marginally changes the \Qy transition, 
this embedding scheme was not applied to the exciton system used in this chapter.

A screening term was also implemented. This followed the same form as that reported
by Mallus \emph{et al.} \cite{Mallus2018}, where any point-charge interaction has
a prefactor screening term that is dependent on the distance between point charges.
For example for a coupling term between two exciton states, a single element in 
the sum of chromophore-chromophore interactions, would be given by

\begin{equation}
    V_{\left(m, 1\right), \left(n,1\right)} = \sum_{A \in m, B \in n} \frac{f}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{q^{\text{tr},A}_m q^{\text{tr},B}_n}{r_{AB}}
    \label{eq:exciton_coupling}
\end{equation}
%
where the definition of variables are the same for equation \ref{eq:exciton_coupling}.
The scaling factor $f$ is given by

\begin{equation}
    f = A \text{exp}\left(-B R_{ij}\right) + f_0
\end{equation}
%
where $A$, $B$ and $f_0$ are constants. 

When employing this screening factor, it was found the only effect was to decouple
the B800 and B850 exciton states. This is best demonstrated in the simulated absorption
spectra for LH2 with and without the screening factor, as well as the breakdown 
of exciton states into the density contributions from each site.

\subsubsection{Absorption Spectra}
\label{subsubsec:abs_spec}

Absorption spectra of LH2 is usually calculated by calculating the intensity of 
transitions for each exciton state and plotting these against the wavelengths of
transitions to these states. 

The intensity of transition $I_k$ from the ground exciton state $\Psi_0$ to a (one)
exciton state $\Psi_k$ is given by

\begin{equation}
    I_k \varpropto E_k \left\lvert \braket{\Psi_k| \hat{\epsilon} \cdot \mathbf{\mu} | \Psi_0} \right\rvert^2
\end{equation}
%
where $E_k$ is the energy of the state $\braket{\Psi_k|H|\Psi_k}$, $\hat{\epsilon}$
is a unit vector in the direction of the polarisation of the incident light, which
to mimic sunlight should follow a random distribution. As the one-exciton states 
are mostly at the same energy the energy factor $E_k$ can be neglected. The overlap
term can then be expanded into the monomer basis giving

\begin{equation}
    I_k \varpropto \left\lvert \sum^N_{j=1} c_{kj} \hat{\epsilon \cdot \mathbf{\mu}_j }\right\rvert^2
\end{equation}
%
where $j,N$ are the index and total number of chlorophyll sites respectively, $c_{kj}$
is the eigenvector coefficient of state $k$ at site $j$, and $\mathbf{\mu_j}$ is 
the transition dipole moment of chlorophyll $j$ 

\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{\mu}_j = \braket{\phi_j^{\left(1\right)}|\mathbf{\mu}|\phi_j^{\left(0\right)}}
\end{equation}
%
. As this intensity is dependent on the orientation of the unit vector $\epsilon$,
the average intensity can be found by either calculating the intensities for a large
distribution of randomised unit vectors and taking the average, or by taking the
analytic spherical average. In the large number limit, the statistical method converges
to the analytic answer.

The simulated LH2 spectra with and without screening factors, alongside the experimental 
spectrum, are shown in fig \ref{fig:LH2_abs_spec}. It can be seen that including
the screening factor does produce better splitting of the B800 and B850 peaks. The
poor fit of the B800 peak to the experimental spectrum has been well discussed in
the literature. A lack of deformation of the ring structures is the most probable
reason for the poor fit of the B800 peak in both screened and unscreened spectra.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.6]{../../Year_3/SpectralDensity/images/absorption_spectra.png}
    \label{fig:LH2_abs_spec}
    \caption{Simulated absorption spectra of LH2, with (dashed line) and without 
    (solid line) a screening factor for point charge interaction. An experimental
    line reconstructed from \emph{et al.} is plotted in black. The simulated spectra
    are shifted to match the position of the 850 nm peak.}
\end{figure}

The lack of different features in the absoprtion spectra imply that the only effect
of using the screening terms is to lower the B800 energy states to better fit the
experimental spectrum. This would be due to the inclusion of B850 site character
into exciton states localised in the B800 ring, but the lack of signficantly differing
features implies this mixing may be minimal. The next section takes a more detailed
look at the density contributions of each site to the exciton states.

\subsubsection{Site Contributions to Exciton Density}
\label{subsubsec:site_dens}

The eigenvector solutions contain the amount of site character in each state, with
the square of this being equal to the exciton density on a specific site. For example,
the second element in each eigenvector is the corresponding amount of character 
from an excitation on the first chlorophyll site (the first element corresponding
to the ground state, with no excitation on any chlorophylls). The average of density
values is shown in figure \ref{fig:LH2_density} for both exciton states calculated
with and without the screening factor, as well as the difference between them. 
Overall, the density contributions show that the ring structures are already significantly
decoupled in the vacuum model, with the screening terms only adding slightly to 
this effect.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.8]{../../Year_3/SpectralDensity/images/screened_density_diff.png}
    \label{fig:LH2_density}
    \caption{Density contributions of site transitions to exciton states for the
    vacuum (left) and screened (middle) Hamiltonian, with the difference shown in
    on the right.}
\end{figure}

The main difference is in the amount of density shared between states localised 
on B800 and B850 sites. The plot of the density difference shows how density is 
localised more on B800 sites for exciton states calculated with the screening
factor. This is also true for the B850 sites. However it does not reduce the delocalisation
of intra-ring sites - the amount of density shared between B850 sites with B850 
sites stays effectively the same. Even without the screening factor, most states
are made of either only B800 or B850 character, with little mixing found.

Overall, whilst is was possible to include embedding effects into the chl-xTB exciton
model, it may not change the overall qualitative behaviour of the exciton states.
Calculating the chlorophyll system in a vacuum would still be a valid choice of
model, and this model has shown to be been effective in the previous investigations.

\section{Spectra}
\label{sec:sites_states_couplings}

The following section reports on the features of spectral densities calculated using
the chl-xTB and exciton method. A more detailed breakdown of peak positions, heights
and assignments can be found in appendix \ref{app:app02}.

\subsection{Sites}
\label{subsec:sites}

In order to confirm the spectral densities calculated with chl-xTB excitons are 
reasonable, spectral densities of monomer chlorophyll \Qy transitions were benchmarked 
against literature data. This was done for a B800 site of LH2 chlorophyll, and the
spectrum can be seen in figure \ref{fig:specdens_lit}.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.8]{../../Year_3/SpectralDensity/images/specdens_literature_comparison.png}
    \label{fig:specdens_lit}
    \caption{Spectral density of the \Qy transition for a chlorophyll in the B800
    ring in LH2. Axis scaling and units are chosen to best reproduce the spectrum
    reported by Mallus \emph{et al.}\cite{Mallus2018}.}
\end{figure}

The use of eV as units of the spectral density and well as frequency is consistent 
with previous literature reports. This first spectrum is compared to the spectral 
density reported by Mallus  \emph{et al.} \cite{Mallus2018}, and uses the same axis 
scalings (max of 0.03 eV for $J\left(\omega\right)$ and 0.1 for $\hbar \omega$). 
Similar features such as the peaks at 0.09, 0.08 and 0.06 eV are found in both. 
The peak at 0.022 eV is not found in the literature comparison. The $J\left(\omega\right)$ 
values of the 0.08 and 0.06 peaks match well, although the 0.09 eV peaks is smaller
in this work.
These small discrepancies can be explained by the different forcefields and response
methods used. It should be noted that this is in the low frequency region of the
spectral density, and the major features are found at much higher frequencies. Features
in this region are attributed to environmental forces \cite{Mallus2018}, and so 
difference in the forcefield and MD methods used would be expected to cause small
differences in the spectra. However the good match of peak positions and the generally
important features indicate that using chl-xTB can reproduce spectral densities
from higher level methods quite well.

The spectra shown in figure \ref{fig:specdens_sites} shows an expanded range of
frequencies up to 0.25 eV, as well as a breakdown by ring type. The three spectra
here are calculated as the average for sites in the B800, B850a and B850b rings.
Whilst many peak positions are similar in all three types, there are differences
in $J\left(\omega\right)$ values that indicate differences in protein environment.
All three show a major feature at 0.165 eV, with magnitudes of around 0.2 eV. The 
next set of largest features are around the 0.2 eV mark. Here differences in the
coupling can be seen. For example the 0.21 eV peak present in B850a and B850b sites,
the largest feature after the 0.165 eV at a magnitude of ~0.185 eV, is not present
in the B800 sites. Similarly the 0.205 eV (height 0.117 eV) present in B800 is not
found in the B850 spectra. A full comparison of peak positions and heights can be
found in appendix \ref{app:app02}. For features found in both ring type sites, it
is generally the case B800 values are higher than B850, which is in line with previous
arguments that the more polar environment around B800 lead to greater variations 
in transition energy \cite{Olbrich2010}.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.8, angle=90, origin=c]{../../Year_3/SpectralDensity/images/specdens_ring_average.png}
    \label{fig:specdens_sites}
    \caption{Average spectral densities for \Qy transitions at sites in the B800,
    B850a and B850b rings.}
\end{figure}

Generally it can be seen that spectral densities calculated with the chl-xTB method
correspond well with previously reported observations. Major features appear at
previously reported frequencies and magnitudes, and environmental effects are reproduced
well. It is discussed later how the efficiency of the chl-xTB method would allow
for better workflows in calculating spectral densities, but that is not in the scope
of the discussion here.

\subsection{Exciton states}
\label{subsec:states}

This section reports on the calculation the spectral density for exciton states.
The work done here differs from similar work previously reported in the literature
as it was possible to perform electronic structure calculations for every chlorophyll
geometry in every frame of the MD simulation. Due to the strong correlation of geometry
variations to \Qy transition property variations, it is expected that the features 
in the spectral density are representative of the environmental coupling to the 
exciton states, rather than any artificial features from a statistical method. It
was found that the spectral densities of exciton transition energies closely match
the monomer site spectra, implying that the environment coupling mainly affects
intra-chlorophyll properties and not the exciton coupling values.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.6]{../../Year_3/SpectralDensity/images/abs_prob_by_energy.png}
    \label{fig:absorption_probabilities}
    \caption{Violin plots of absorption probabilities for exciton states, positioned
    by the average transition energy from the ground state. The width of each distribution 
    indicates the density of absoprtion probabilities, with crosses marking the 
    mean value.}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.8, angle=90, origin=c]{../../Year_3/SpectralDensity/images/specdens_state_spectra.png}
    \label{fig:specdens_states}
    \caption{Spectral densities of exciton transition energies of LH2, weigthed by
    the averaged absorption probability. The highest energy state is indicated in 
    red. This state has a higher fluctuation in energy, causing excess noise in
    the spectral density.}
\end{figure}

The exciton spectral density was calculated using the time series of the exciton
transition energies (calculated as the difference between a given state and the
exciton ground state) of each state (bar the ground state). The spectra shown in 
figure \ref{fig:specdens_states} have been weighted in color by their time-average
absorption probabilities (shown in figure \ref{fig:absorption_probabilities}) to
clearly present the features in the spectra. From figure \ref{fig:absorption_probabilities}
it can be seen that there are two "bright" states, which are the 2nd and 3rd lowest
in transition energy. These absorption probabilities only consider ground to excited 
transitions, and not the transition probability between exciton states. There is
one outlier state in these spectra, marked in red - this corresponds to the highest
energy state, and the increase in $J\left(\omega\right)$ values are attributed to 
increased variations in this states energy, which would exacerbate the noise in 
the spectrum. Discussion of this state is limited due to this effect, as well as 
the fact that it may not be the most important state to consider as the absorption
probability to this state is the lowest.

Looking at the 2nd lowest energy state, the main features appear at near identical
frequency positions as the site spectra. The largest feature is at 0.165 eV, with
a magnitude of 12.183 meV. Similarly, peaks at 0.211 eV and 0.218 eV have large
amplitudes at 6.775 meV and 8.62 meV respectively. Full assignments can be found
in appendix \ref{app:app02}.

From the change in scale on the y-axis, it is obvious that the environmental effect
on exicton states is much smaller that for sites. This is explained by the lack
of correlation between chlorophyll motions, generally cancelling out any variation
in \Qy transition properties, mostly staying close to the mean. This would reduce
the fluctuation of exciton transition energies, which in turn would decrease the
magnitude of any peak in the spectral density.

The similarity of the exciton state and the site spectra implies that the protein
environment effect on the transition at a single chlorophyll site is much greater 
than any effect on the exciton coupling between chlorophyll sites. What this indicates
is the lack of any large scale environmental effects on multiple chlorophyll sites,
and that all of the environment effects are localised at each site. This does not 
exclude the possibility that exciton coupling variations can be present, just that
these would most likely be due to intra-chlorophyll variations, and not, for example,
a large scale movement of the protein structure to bring chlorophylls closer together
or change the angle between porphyrin planes. The next section looks at the variations
in coupling values in greater detail.

\afterpartskip
\subsection{Coupling}
\label{subcsec:coupling}

The spectral density of the coupling terms were calculated with the same method
as the state and site transition energies, and are shown in figure \ref{fig:specdens_coupling}.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.8, angle=90, origin=c]{../../Year_3/SpectralDensity/images/specdens_coupling.png}
    \label{fig:specdens_coupling}
    \caption{Spectral density of exciton state coupling values (i.e. off diagonal
    elements of the exciton Hamiltonian) of LH2 coloured by average distance between 
    chlorophyll sites.}
\end{figure}

It can be seen that there are far fewer features in the coupling spectral density
than in the site and state transition spectra. Additionally there is a broad feature
at the low frequency end of the spectrum, around 0.01 eV. Intuitively, the magnitude
of the spectral density decreases as the separation of chloroyphlls increase, with
anything but nearest neighbours showing signficant value against the strongest coupling 
spectrum.

Taking the largest valued spectrum, where the distance between the two chlorophylls
was the smallest with an average 15.9 $\AA{}$, the high frequency features correspond 
to features found in the exciton state and site spectra. The strongest features are 
found at 0.201, 0.203 and 0.205 eV, with strengths of 0.416, 0.457 and 0.372 meV 
respectively. These correspond with major features in the site spectra, implying 
that these are due to intra-chlorophyll variations rather than any change in the
 protein scaffold.

Previous arguments about coupling terms have said that the change in distance is
the controlling factor. The effect of distance was also investigated by calculating
the spectral density of the interchromophore distance (reported without units as 
these are not physically meaningful). These spectra can be seen in \ref{fig:specdens_distance}. 

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.8, angle=90, origin=c]{../../Year_3/SpectralDensity/images/specdens_distance.png}
    \label{fig:specdens_distance}
    \caption{Spectral density of the separation between nearest neighbour sites
    in LH2.}
\end{figure}

It can be seen that while there is some correspondence to the exciton coupling spectra 
in the low frequency region, there is little correspondence to features in the high
frequency region. The strongest features at 0.169, 0.175, 0.180 and 0.182 eV do
not correspond to frequencies present in other spectra. The largest feature in
this distance spectral density is at 0.003 eV, which is at a similar frequency to a
low frequency peak in the coupling spectra. However, these peaks are qualitatively 
different, with the exciton coupling peak being much broader. This low frequency
peak in the exciton coupling spectra is relatively weak compared to the intra-chlorophyll
motion coupling peaks.

The lack of peaks in the coupling spectra from 0.03 eV to 0.168 eV also supports
the argument that intra-chromophore variations, and not the protein structure movements,
are the determining factor in exciton state transition energy variations.

Overall, it can be seen that whilst some exciton coupling variations may be due to
changes in the protein scaffold moving chlorophylls, generally this has little affect
on the exciton state spectral densities. The similarity between major features in 
the coupling spectral density and site and state spectra imply again that almost 
all variation originates at chlorophyll sites.

\section{Assigning Specific Motions}
\label{sec:monomer_dimer_assign}

The observation that variations in exciton state energies are primarly due to intra-chromophore 
variations opens the question about which motions are causing these varitions. Discussion
of these spectra so far has been limited due to the lack of assignment of specific
motions that are coupling to the environment. This section reports on some of the
tests used to assign features in the spectral densities. This includes comparing
the LH2 spectral densities to a spectral density of monomer chlorophyll embedded
in diethyl ether, as well as a spectrum constructed from Huang-Rhys factors calculated
with chl-xTB response properties and a GFN1-xTB hessian. Some speculative explanations
of the lack of low frequency features are also given.

\subsection{Ether system}
\label{subsec:specdens_ether}

So far only the environmental coupling of LH2 has been considered. Whilst some differences
between the ring sites have been observed, it is not clear how other environments 
couple to the \Qy transition. A candidate environment of chlorophyll in diethyl 
ether was investigated, to match the previous chapters. The conclusion from comparing
the spectral density of chlorophyll in diethyl ether would lie between two extremes
- either there is no variation in the spectral density, or major variation. The first
possibility would support the argument that the LH2 protein does not do anything 
discernable to chlorophyll spectral densities, whereas the second would imply that
the protein environment does need to be considered more carefully.

The time series of chlorophyll geometries were taken from an MD simulation of a 
diethyl-ether embedded chlorophyll. This was constructed using a solvent box made
with the \code{packmol} program with a single chlorophyll  molecule in a 64 $\AA{}$
box with 1054 diethyl-ether molecules. The simulation was run with OpenMM using
parameters for chlorophyll taken from the LH2 forceifield, and parameters for diethyl-ether
taken from the General Amber ForceField (GAFF). The system was equilibriated for 
60 ps, with a production workflow of 300 ps run. Structures were taken every 2 fs.
A Langevin integrator set at 300 K was used with a timestep of 2 fs.

The \Qy transition was calculated for every frame of the MD trajectory. The spectral
density of these transition energies was calculated with the same method as the 
previous spectra. The spectral density can be seen in figure \ref{fig:specdens_ether}.

\end{figure}

The major peaks are found at similar frequencies to the site andstate spectra, albeit
with different magnitudes. The strongest feature in the diethyl-ether spectrum is
at 0.21 eV, with a magnitude of 0.241 eV. The next strongest feature is at 0.165 
eV, the frequency of the strongest peaks in the site and state spectra, but at a
magnitude of 0.232 eV. The collection of features at 0.186 eV, 0.191 eV, 0.195 eV
and 0.201 eV are also present with magnitudes of 0.15 eV, 0.069 eV, 0.08 eV and 
0.103 eV.

It can be seen that the features in the spectral density for diethy-ether embedded
chlorophyll are similar to the features from the LH2 chlorophyll and exciton transitions.
This implies that the coupling of environment to energy fluctuations is due to mostly
intrinsic properties of the chlorophyll geometry. There is still some variation 
in the magnitudes of the environmental coupling, however the lack of any features
at different frequencies or major changes in coupling magnitudes imply little effect
originating from the environment. Overall coupling between chlorophyll transition
energies and the environment are controlled by intrinsic chlorophyll properties.

\subsection{Huang Rhys Factors}
\label{subsec:hrf}

These intrinsic properties that cause features in the spectral density would most
likely be the coupling of internal vibrational motions of chlorophyll to the \Qy transition. 
A larger coupling of vibrational motion would imply greater variation in the \Qy 
transition energy, which would increase the magnitude of features in the spectral
density. The coupling of normal modes to electron transition can be calculated with
Huang-Rhys factors, defined by the difference between minima in the excited and
ground state energy surfaces along normal mode coordinates. By comparing the Huang-Rhys
factors of all normal modes of a chlorophyll molecule, it would be possible to identify
which internal motions are responsible for spectral density features.

The normal modes used to calculate Huang-Rhys factors were calculated with a hessian
calculation on an optimised single chlorophyll structure. It was found that rotations
in the phytol tail caused issues in converging to an optimised geometry, attributed
to the low energy barrier for C-C bond rotation. The phytol tail was removed to
overcome this issue, with a hydrogen atom replacing the phytol group. The optimised
geometry was then used to calculate normal modes with GFN1-xTB.

A scan of excitation energies was calculated for each normal mode, with the chlorophyll
atoms being displaced along the vectors derived from the hessian of the optimised
chlorophyll structure. The coordinate of the scan was defined as 

\begin{equation}
    q_i = \sqrt{\frac{\omega_i}{\hbar}} x^m_i
\end{equation}
%
where $\omega_i$ is the angular frequency of the normal mode $i$ and $x^m_i$ is
the displacement vector in mass weighted coordinates. The \Qy transition energy 
was calculated for a series of structures with successive values of $q_i$. Fits 
of the ground state and excited state energies were made with quadratic functions,
from which it was possible to make estimates of the $q$ value for a minimum ground
state energy ($q_{\text{ground}}$) and excited state energy ($q_{\text{excited}}$).

From these it was possible to calculate the Huang-Rhys factors as

\begin{equation}
    d = \frac{\left(q_{\text{excited}} - q_{\text{excited}}\right)^2}{2}
\end{equation}
%
. These Huang-Rhys factors were then used to construct a spectral density, using
their absolute value for amplitude and the frequency of the corresponding normal
mode as position in the frequency domain. A plot of this spectra is shown in figure 
\ref{fig:specdens_hrf}.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.8, angle=90, origin=c]{../../Year_3/SpectralDensity/images/hrf_spectrum.png}
    \label{fig:specdens_hrf}
    \caption{A simulated spectral density of the \Qy transition for chlorophyll 
    constructed from Huang-Rhys factors and the frequency of normal modes. Labeled
    peaks are chosen as modes that may correspond to features in other chlorophyll
    spectral densities.}
\end{figure}

The low frequency (<0.05 eV) modes in this spectra are clearly suppressed in LH2
and diethyl-ether environments. Due to these motions corresponding to large scale
deformations of the porphyrin ring, the high force constants would be expected to
make these motions unobservable. It is  fairly clear that they should not explain
any features in the spectral densities.

The high frequency normal modes correspondence to spectral density features is less
clear. Whilst some peaks in the Huang-Rhys spectrum are similar to the full spectral
density, the overall change in frequency positions make comparison difficult. This
could be due to the completely different vibration modes present, however it is 
more likely that whole sections of normal modes have been shifted from the frequencies
observed in the spectral densities, due to the differences in the forcefield and
GFN1-xTB method. The motions themselves should be similar, even if the frequencies 
are not. This implies that the major features in the Huang-Rhys spectrum should 
correspond with major features in other spectral densities. These modes have been
labeled in figure \ref{fig:specdens_hrf}. All of these modes have signficant movement
in the $N_A$, $N_B$, $N_C$ and $N_D$ atoms, corresponding with a symmetry breaking
along the \Qy dipole axis. This is shown in figure \ref{fig:hrf_vibrations}.

    \caption{Motions of the four central nitrogen atoms in bacterial chlorophyll
    for the vibrational modes labelled in figure \ref{fig:specdens_hrf}.}
\end{figure}

In total the Huang-Rhys factors do not offer a clean explanation of spectral density
features. It could be that using normal modes calculated with the same forcefield
method might improve the comparison, but this was not possible with the resources
available. However looking at the atomic motions more explicitly could explain some
of the features observed.

\subsection{N Axes Deformation}
\label{subsec:N_axes_deformation}

The motion of the $N_A$-$N_C$ and $N_B$-$N_D$ axes inducing a $D_{4h}$-$C_{s}$ symmetry
break in the vibrational modes with the highest Huang-Rhys factors could suggest
that many of the major spectral density features are due to this motion. As it is
possible to construct a time series of a metric to describe this deformation, it
would be possible to compare the spectral density of these motions to the transition
energy spectral densities. The chosen metric was the ratio of $N_A$-$N_C$ and $N_B$-$N_D$
length, and the spectral density of this property is shown in figure \ref{fig:specdens_N_axes},
again without amplitude units as these would be physically meaningless. In order
to account for all chlorophyll sites, the spectral density was calculated for each
site and then averaged.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.8, angle=90, origin=c]{../../Year_3/SpectralDensity/images/specdens_N_axes.png}
    \label{fig:specdens_N_axes}
    \caption{Spectral density of the ratio $\frac{\left\lvert N_A\text{-}N_C \right\rvert}{\left\lvert N_B\text{-}N_D \right\rvert}$,
    averaged over chlorophyll sites in LH2.}
\end{figure}

Whilst the major site/state feature at 0.165 eV is also present in this N axes spectrum,
there is little correspondence in other peaks. The majority of peaks are in the 
0.022-0.121 eV range, which is not populated in the transition energy spectra, and
the only two corresponding peaks are at 0.165 eV and 0.205 eV, with the latter only
present in B800 sites. Overall this metric offers little in explanation of which
motions are responsible for transition energy spectral density features, with the
exception of the major 0.165 eV peak. Whilst a little surprising that most features
must be due to over vibrational motions of chlorophyll, it is encouraging that the
major feature corresponds to a $D_{4h}$-$C_{s}$ symmetry breaking motion. 

Full assignment of the spectral density features is outside the scope of this work,
but it can be seen that there are two possible options for further investigation.
One would be producing hessians from forcefield parameters, which would make a more
compelling comparison of Huang-Rhys factors and spectral density features. The second
would be a more thorough look at all atomic motions, creating a large series of 
spectral densities of geometry metrics. The issue with this investigation would 
still be the lack of correspondence between spectral density features and normal
mode vibrations, however it may shed light on which chlorophyll atoms are particularly
important to spectral density features.
