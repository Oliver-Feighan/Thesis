\chapter{Exciton Models of Chlorophyll Dimers}
\label{chap:excitons}

\subsubsection*{Previous Published Work}
Parts of the work presented in this chapter are also included in a paper published 
with Dr Susannah Bourne-Worster. These are reported in section \ref{sec:concentration_quenching}.


\initial {T}his chapter investigates whether an exciton framework based on Chl-xTB
performs accurately enough for LHC models. Exciton coupling elements, describing the
interaction of separate excited states in an oligomer chlorophyll network, are dependent
on both transition energies as well as transition densities, as described in section
\ref{sec:frenkel_exciton_theory}.

Whilst the methods discussed in the introduction are good examples for calculating exciton
Hamiltonian matrix elements, there are drawbacks that inhibit realizing a full,
almost \emph{ab initio}, LHC model. For the machine learning methods, this includes
explicit embedding effects, as environment interactions can only be included implicitly
in the training data. For TD-DFT, the cost of calculations necessitates cutbacks
in detail. Additionally the complex interaction of excited states on separate sites
makes gradient terms intractable, \cite{Stross2016} if dynamic simulations are desired.
Wide-reaching semi-empirical methods, such as sTDA-xTB and ZINDO, can be seen in
the previous chapter to be too inaccurate to capture more minute details of the 
geometry dependence of \Qy transition properties. Given the energy proximity of 
excited states in the LH2 network, these inaccuracy would be exacerbated when carried
forward into exciton Hamiltonians.

Using Chl-xTB as the engine for exciton models offers to solve many of these issues.
For the monomer properties examined in the previous chapter, it can be seen to be
nearly as accurate as TD-DFT is when comparing different functionals. Correct embedding 
effects, explicitly unincorporated in the training set, are accurately regained
when using Chl-xTB to new species and environments. The \dscf/SPA and semi-empirical 
inspired approach to excited states has kept computational efficiency high. Combined,
these benefits anticipate LHC models which can accurately capture the interplay
of the expansive environment (protein scaffold and solvent) and the complex quantum
system inside, with an efficiency that can probe interesting and important phenomena.

A good example of such phenomena is the rate of conversion from vertical excited
states (ES) to charge-separated (CS) states in embedded chlorophyll dimers. The ES$\rightarrow$CS
transfer pathway is an important proposed mechanism for fluorescent quenching in
LHCs, which directly impacts the quantum efficiency of harvesting light. Understanding 
how the design of LHCs inhibits this pathway is key to designing similarly efficient
artificial light harvesting materials.

Several other proposed mechanisms of fluorescence quenching have been already been 
excluded, being easier to model or experimentally determine. For example, impurity-formed
trap states, inter-system crossing to triplet states and collisions with quenching
quenching species have been ruled out by Porter \emph{et al.} \cite{Kelly1970}. 
The concentration-independence spectral features of chlorophyll also rules out aggregate
chlorophyll formation as a mechanism for quenching \cite{Kelly1970, Kelly1971, Beddard1976a}. 
It is hypothesised that the CT state is the mostly likely candidate for a trap state,
\cite{Gutschick1978, Seely1978, Kelly1971} the existence of which is connoted by 
fluorescence decay kinetics  \cite{Yuen1980}.

Currently, established methods are unsuitable for computing the energy surfaces of 
LHC excited states required to examine electron transfer rates of this complexity 
in great detail. It follows that as the protein environment is highly influential
to these rates, the environment must be included in the energy surface coordinate
space. Including the environment however introduces a huge number of degrees of 
freedom which need to be sufficiently sampled, accurately, to obtain energy surfaces. 
With an efficient, accurate and adaptable method in hand, realizing these states
is possible.

The aim of this chapter is then to go beyond monomer chlorophyll properties, and 
utilize the benefits of the protocol established in the previous chapter to realize
more detailed models of LHCs. To establish accuracy in this expanded regime, the 
properties of exciton states, which have nuanced differences to monomer excited 
states, are examined against established methods. Specifically, accurate descriptions
of the dependence of exciton energies with relative orientation and separation of 
chlorophylls require attesting. Once established, this chapter showcases the benefits
of the Chl-xTB exciton model to the problem of understanding LHC inhibition of 
charge-transfer fluorescence quenching.

\section{Frenkel Exciton Hamiltonian}
\label{sec:exciton_theory}

\subsection{Exciton States}
\label{subsec:exciton_states}
As stated in the introduction, a large majority of models of light harvesting systems
utilize a Frenkel-Davydov Hamiltonian model of exciton states \cite{Curutchet2016, Cignoni2022}, 
where the weak coupling between monomers mean that a model can be constructed from
properties of the individual sites.

To recap the exciton theory from chapter \ref{chap:background_theory}, the exciton 
states $\ket{\Psi}$ can be constructed as a Hartree product of the states of individual 
sites (the monomers or chromophores in LHCs)

\begin{equation}
    \ket{\Psi} = \Pi_m \ket{\phi_m}
\end{equation}
%
where $\ket{\phi_m}$ is the monomer state on site $m$. These monomer states form
the basis function of the overall excitonic states. As the exciton is modelled to
be localised to a specific site, an exciton state with an exciton at site $i$ is
given by

\begin{equation}
    \ket{\Psi}^i = \ket{\phi_i}^\ast \Pi_{m \neq i}  \ket{\phi_m}
\end{equation}
%
where $\ket{\phi_i}^\ast$ is the excited state of monomer site $i$. States with 
more than one exciton are possible in this framework, but this is not usual for 
many light harvesting system models where the interaction between these states is
weak. The Hamiltonian, including what is termed the ground state, where there are 
no excitons in the system, is given by

\begin{equation}
    H = 
    \begin{bmatrix}
        E_0 & V_{0, \left(1, 1\right)} & \cdots & V_{0, \left(N, 1\right)} \\
        V_{0, \left(1, 1\right)} & E_{\left(1,1\right)} & \cdots & V_{\left(1,1\right) \left(N, 1\right)} \\
        \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
        V_{0, \left(N, 1\right)} & V_{\left(1,1\right) \left(N, 1\right)} & \cdots & E_{\left(N, 1\right)}
    \end{bmatrix}
    \label{eq:exciton_H_matrix}
\end{equation}
%
where $N$ is equal to the total number of individual sites. The diagonal terms $E$
is the sum of the site energies and a point charge interaction

\begin{equation}
    E_0 = \sum_m e_m + \sum_{m \neq n, A \in m, B \in n} \frac{q^A_m q^B_n}{r_{AB}}
\end{equation}
%
where $e_m$ is the energy of site $m$ and $q^A_m$ is the charge centered on atom
$A$ in site $m$. Hamiltonian elements corresponding to a single excitation are similarly
given except with the excited state energy and charges

\begin{equation}
    E_{\left(m,1\right)} = e_m + \Delta e_m + \sum_{n \neq m} e_n + \sum_{n, A \in m, B \in n} \frac{q^{\ast A}_m q^B_n}{r_{AB}} + \sum_{n,p \neq m, A \in n, B \in p} \frac{q^{A}_n q^B_p}{r_{AB}}
\end{equation}
%
where $\Delta e_m$ is the excitation energy of site $m$, and charges marked $q^\ast$
are the excited state charges. The inter-chromophre term has been replaced to explicitly
show that both interaction of excited state point charges with other sites, as well
as ground-state/ground-state interactions, are included.

The off diagonal elements are the coupling elements between all exciton states.
For coupling to the ground state, these are given by

\begin{equation}
    V_{0, \left(m,1\right)} = \sum_{n, A \in m, B \in n} \frac{q^{\text{tr},A}_m q^B_n}{r_{AB}}
\end{equation}
%
where charges marked $q^{\text{tr}}$ are transition charges. It can be seen that 
this coupling element includes an electrostatic interaction between all sites and
the excited site. This is different to coupling elements between two single exciton
states, given as

\begin{equation}
    V_{\left(m, 1\right), \left(n,1\right)} = \sum_{A \in m, B \in n} \frac{q^{\text{tr},A}_m q^{\text{tr},B}_n}{r_{AB}}
    \label{eq:exciton_coupling}
\end{equation}
%
which just involve sites $m$, $n$ which have local excitations.

This Hamiltonian for exciton states is slightly different to those previously reported 
in the literature, as the ground state, where no excitons are present, is not usually
included. Usually the local excitations are sufficiently high in energy and the
couplings between ground and excited states are weak enough that the ground state 
eigensolution is usually unmixed with the local excitations. The excited state eigensolutions
have very little ground state character, and so the block matrix of just excited
state contributions would return the Hamiltonian used in many other studies.

\section{Benchmarking the exciton model against full dimer excited states}
\label{sec:exction_v_full_dimer}

It has been well established in many other studies that the Frenkel exciton Hamiltonian
can predict dimer excited state properties well \cite{Kenny2016, Sisto2014a}. A 
similar type of study is repeated here to set a benchmark for the later comparison
with chl-xTB. Well known causes of error between the exciton model and full TD-DFT,
such as inter-chromophore distance and treatment of coupling of excited states, 
can be examined with two studies: first comparing the transition energies predicted
by the exciton model against full TD-DFT for a set of chlorophylls from LH2; second 
examining a conformational scan of chlorophyll dimers along rotational axes, to 
pinpoint if errors may be due to any specific interactions.

\subsection{Exciton accuracy in LH2 Chlorophyll Dimers}
\label{subsec:LH2_exciton_camb3lyp}

Response properties were calculated for a series of chlorophyll dimers taken from
the LH2 protein, using CAM-B3LYP/Def2-SVP TD-DFT. The chlorophyll dimer systems
were taken from the previously used set of LH2 MD structures \cite{Stross2016},
with the phytyl tails removed for easier calculation. Transition energies were
calculated for the full dimer systems, as well as from the exciton model, constructed 
with monomer TD-DFT calculations on the two chlorophylls in each dimer. The transition
energies for the exciton model were calculated as the difference between the excited and ground states. 
A scatter plot of these transition energies is shown in figure \ref{fig:camb3lyp_excitons}. 

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{../../Year_2/DimerModel/CAMB3LYP_exciton_v_tddft_coupling_and_distance.png}
    \caption{The correlation of lowest excitations in LH2 chlorophyll dimer systems
    predicted by the exciton model constructed from monomer TD-DFT and TD-DFT of
    the full dimer system. Scatter points are coloured by the coupling value between
    exciton states (left) and distance between magnesium centres (right).}
    \label{fig:camb3lyp_excitons}
\end{figure}

The RMSE between the exciton and full dimer CAM-B3LYP models is 7.3 meV, well below
the threshold of LH2 \Qy transition energy variation (0.2--0.4 eV), and the correlation
between these two models is near perfect with an $R^2$ value of 0.98. The systems 
in which there is any some can be seen to be cases with small distance between the
monomers, with a smaller distance giving a higher error. There is a lower amount
of correlation with the coupling value from the exciton Hamiltonian (taken as the
coupling between the excited states, as generally the coupling value to the ground
state is lower), implying that at small separations there are effects that are not
included in the exciton model. These effects could be from higher energy transitions, 
such as the $Q_x$ transition, or charge transfer transitions. However for the large 
majority of cases the exciton model predicts full dimer TD-DFT with decent accuracy, 
within the range of previously reported exciton models.

\subsection{Systematic Rotation of Chlorophyll Dimer Orientations}
\label{subsec:rotation}

Further investigations into the breakdown of the exciton model, especially resulting
in inaccuracy in the coupling terms, require a more systematic approach than a stochastic
collection of LH2 dimers. Scans of dimer conformations would systematically show 
whether qualitative descriptions of dimer coupling diverge between the full dimer 
and exciton models. 

As explored in the introduction, many previous investigations treated inter-chromophore
coupling with a point dipole interaction

\begin{equation}
    v_{mn} = \frac{\vec{\mu}_m \cdot \vec{\mu}_n}{R_{mn}}
\end{equation}
%
where $\vec{\mu}_m$ is the dipole on site $m$ and $R_{mn}$ is the inter-chromophore
distance, due to the large separation of chromophores in LHCs. From this expression
it can be seen that there are two inter-chromophore coordinates. These coordinates 
are the angle between transition dipole moments, and distance between the monomers centres.
As the results from the LH2 dimers above explores the relationship with distance,
any unexplored effects would be seen through a scan of the relative dimer orientations.

Artificial dimer systems were constructued with controlled angles between the planes
of the porphyrin rings and the $N_A$-$N_C$ or $N_B$-$N_D$ axis, dependent on which
axis of rotation was used to subtend the dimers. All dimers were constructed from
two truncated chlorophyll molecules with the porphyrin planes initially parallel
and overlapping. The axis along the magnesium atoms was used to defined the separation, 
and as this axis is approximately the cross product of the $N_A$-$N_C$ axis and $N_B$-$N_D$ axis,
which align with the \Qy and $Q_x$ transition dipoles respectively, this axis is labelled
$Q_z$. In a similar fashion, the axis of rotation along the $N_A$-$N_C$ axis is 
termed \Qy and along the $N_B$-$N_D$ axis is termed $Q_x$. After separation, the
angle between monomers was increased in increments of 3.6 degrees up to a full 360
degree rotation for all of the \Qy, $Q_x$, $Q_z$ axes as axes of rotation. The magnesium
atom was the centre of rotation. For the $Q_z$ rotation the separation was 7 $\AA{}$,
a little less than the average separation of 9 $\AA{}$ found in LH2 - this was to 
done to maximise the coupling in the exciton model to exaggerate any errors. For 
the \Qy and $Q_x$ axes this separation was around 15 $\AA{}$ to be able to fit a 
full rotation without the individual chromophores overlapping. The initial system
and the axes of rotation can be seen in figure \ref{fig:dimer_system}.

In order to make assignment of exciton states easier, the geometries of the two 
truncated chlorophyll monomers were altered such that there would be a distinct 
gap in their transition energies. This gap was not wider than the variation in 
transition energies found in LH2 monomers. More detail on assigning transition 
energies to the correct excited state is discussed below.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.4]{../../Year_2/DimerModel/Scans/dimer_system.png}
    \caption{Diagram of the artificial dimer system, showing the axes of rotations
    in green and the chosen sites for calculating distance between functional groups
    in orange.}
    \label{fig:dimer_system}
\end{figure}

Comparisons of the excited state energy can be seen in figures \ref{fig:camb3lyp_Qz_rotation},
\ref{fig:camb3lyp_Qx_rotation}, \ref{fig:camb3lyp_Qy_rotation}. The same trends 
in the profile of excited state energies can be seen both the full dimer system 
and exciton models. The minima and maxima are found at the same positions in both, 
and the qualitative trends in curvature are also similar. The only major discrepancy
is seen in the 150-200 $^{\circ}$ region in the $Q_x$ profile, where the exciton 
model predicts the higher excited state at a little above the TD-DFT profile. A 
similar effect is seen in the LH2 dimers, where the errors in transition energies 
are almost all overestimates, and is attributed to a higher coupling value in the
exciton model than is present in TD-DFT. This higher coupling could be due to the
asymptotic behavior of a bare point charge interaction. Using a short range damping
operator might correct this, but this would be outside the scope of this work.
It should be noted that the angle between nearest neighbour chlorophylls is either
$\approx 0 ^{\circ}$ in the B850 rings, or $\approx 90 ^{\circ}$ for B800-B850 pairs,
and so much of this space is not explored in the LH2 protein. For other light 
harvesting complexes there would be more variation in angle between chlorophyll 
monomers. Additionally, non-nearest neighbour pairs would also explore more of the 
angle space, however these dimers are further apart so would have much lower coupling
values.

\end{figure}

\end{figure}

    and the exciton model (right) for chlorophyll dimer geometries with one monomer
    rotated around the $Q_y$ axis.}
    \label{fig:camb3lyp_Qy_rotation}
\end{figure}

Overall it can be seen that the exciton model predicts TD-DFT excited states and
transition energies well. Reasons for error are due to known issues with the exciton
model. These could be addressed by using more detailed methods for calculating the
coupling values between exciton states, or by including other transitions that may
change the character of these states.

\section{chl-xTB Excitons}
\label{sec:chl_xTB_excitons}

\subsection{Benchmarking the Chl-xTB Exciton Framework}
\label{subsec:pbe0_and_chl_xtb_dimer}

\subsubsection{Discarding PBE0}
\label{subsec:state_assign}

While in the previous section is was possible to compare excited state energies
with the same CAM-B3LYP functional for both dimer and monomer properties, it was
found this was not the case for Chl-xTB as well as the PBE0/Def2-SVP reference method.
For Chl-xTB, the obvious flaw is that the method was parameterised for monomer chlorophyll
properties and not dimers. Additionally it was found that dimer transition energies
had systematic errors, which are attributed to the underlying xTB framework.

Ideally, the next-best comparison to replace dimer Chl-xTB would have been dimer
PBE0. However it was found that the transitions from PBE0/Def2-SVP were not well
defined, having charge transfer character that is not present in the CAM-B3LYP
dimer transitions, attributed to the long-range corrections. This effect can be seen
in the distribution of transition energies, shown in figure \ref{fig:camb3lyp_pbe0_distributions}. 
Here the individual \Qy and higher energy transitions that are well resolved by 
CAM-B3LYP are not well resolved when using PBE0. Transition energies from PBE0 are 
uncorrelated to CAM-B3LYP transitions, as seen in figure \ref{fig:pbe0_camb3lyp_coupling},
due to this charge-transfer artifact. Hence the PBE0 dimer data does not make a 
good comparison for either the PBE0 exciton or the chl-xTB exciton models, and so
was discarded from benchmarking. For the remaining sections, the exciton model is
compared to CAM-B3LYP TD-DFT.

    data.}

\subsubsection{Assignment of States}
\label{subsec:state_assign}

In the comparison between CAM-B3LYP full dimer TD-DFT and exciton model, both method
gave excited states with the same energy ordering. Assigning and comparing the same
excited states was therefore straightforward. However it was found that for some
dimer pairs, the exciton states constructed with PBE0 and Chl-xTB would predict 
different energy ordering. For example, for an A-B  dimer system, one model might
predict a state with the exciton localized on monomer A as the lower energy states,
whereas CAM-B3LYP might predict the state with the exciton on B as the lower energy 
state. It should be noted that the CAM-B3LYP exciton model and CAM-B3LYP full dimer
data were always consistent, and it was only when comparing to PBE0 or chl-xTB that
this effect apparent.

It is therefore necessary to find the location of the excitons in both dimer and
exciton models. For the TD-DFT dimer result, the exciton location was taken as the
molecule where the transition charge distribution was localised. This centre $\mathbf{c}$
was calculated by taking the average of the charge positions $\mathbf{r}$ weighted
by the absolute transition charge value $\left\lvert q^{\text{tr}} \right\rvert$

\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{c} = \frac{\sum_i \left\lvert q^{\text{tr}}_i \right\rvert \mathbf{r}_i}{\sum_i \left\lvert q^{\text{tr}}_i \right\rvert}
\end{equation}
%
where $i$ is an index for all atoms in the dimer. Whilst the "centre of charge"
is generally a poorly defined property for a system of point charges with zero total
charge, these centres predicted with the above equation were found to be located close
to the Mg centre of the truncated chlorophylls, and so is assumed to be a decent
metric for the "transition centre".

For the Frenkel exciton result, the location was taken as the monomer corresponding
to the dominant character in the eigenvector solution. For example, if the diagonal
elements of the Hamiltonian in order of ground state, transition on A, transition
on B, and the eigenvector solution of the lower energy exciton state had the greatest
value in its second element, the "transition on A" character, the exciton was assigned
as localized on monomer A.

\subsubsection{Comparison}
\label{subsec:state_assign}

Figure \ref{fig:chl_xtb_pbe0_LH2} shows transition energies from the exciton model,
constructed with PBE0 and Chl-xTB monomer data, against dimer TD-DFT data with CAM-B3LYP
(i.e. the same domain as figure \ref{fig:camb3lyp_excitons}). For the PBE0 model,
the RMSE and $R^2$ is 0.296 eV and 0.75 respectively, with the Chl-xTB model performing
similarly with RMSE and $R^2$ of 0.210 eV and 0.66 respectively. Whilst the correlation
is not as good as the CAM-B3LYP exciton model, there is still a clear relationship 
that supports the hypothesis that using the exciton model with lower level methods can
still reproduce qualitative responses found from higher level data.

The systematic shift observed in both RMSEs is equivalent to the shift found in 
monomer transitions in the previous chapter. The standard deviation of the errors 
was also found to be similar to the values reported in the last chapter.

The two possible leading causes of error would be the exciton model or the theory 
used for monomer properties. From the CAM-B3LYP exciton comparison in figure \ref{fig:camb3lyp_excitons},
it was concluded that the correlation of close proximity of monomers, related to 
high coupling values, to the overestimation of transition energy implied that the 
exciton model was the leading cause of error. Hence it is implied that where there
is large separation and low coupling between chromophores, the exciton model would 
have little effect and so any error here would be due to the monomer model used. 
The origin of error being from the monomer method then explains the behavior seen
in the PBE0 and chl-xTB exciton scatters - the error in the low coupling regions
is due to the monomer theory rather than the exciton theory. When there is large
coupling, the error in monomer properties is compounded with error in the exciton
model. It can be seen that for high coupling values there is either a cancellation
of errors, with some points being firmly in the middle of the pack, or addition 
of errors, giving the outliers.

The conclusion from these benchmarks is slightly different to the earlier same-functional
benchmarking. Whereas in the earlier benchmark, improvements in the exciton model
would be expected to give better transition energies, here improvements in the underlying
monomer methods would give the greatest improvement. This is a similar conclusion
to the choice of electronic theory against choice of response theory discussed in
chapter \ref{chap:dscf}. However as the Chl-xTB method behaves similarly to PBE0,
it would be hard to justify changes other than changing the functional for the training 
set data. The choice to do this would be almost arbitrary - a PBE0 exciton model has
been shown to work well in past investigations, and so even though there is error
to CAM-B3LYP data it would still be expected to perform well in investigations on 
light harvesting complexes.

    dimer TD-DFT transition energies, coloured by the coupling values.}
    \label{fig:chl_xtb_pbe0_LH2}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Chl-xTB Scans}
\label{subsubsec:chl_xtb_scans}

Similar to the CAM-B3LYP scans above, the profile of excited dimer states was a useful
test in detailing the accuracy of Chl-xTB excitons. For the same reasons as the
LH2 dimers, this benchmarking could not be done against chl-xTB or PBE0 dimer properties,
and so was compared to CAM-B3LYP again. Similar qualitative reproductions of the
excited states were found, although interestingly with slightly better separations
of the two excited states than before. Apart from differences in the magnitudes 
of the monomer charges, it is hard to attribute this improved accuracy to anything
notable.

\begin{figure}

    \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{../../Year_2/DimerModel/Scans/rotation_along_Qz.png}
    \caption{Dimer excited state energies predicted by full dimer TD-DFT (left)

    dimer geometries with one monomer rotated around the $Q_z$ axis.}

\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{../../Year_2/DimerModel/Scans/rotation_along_Qy.png}
    \caption{Dimer excited state energies predicted by full dimer TD-DFT (left)

\end{figure}

\begin{figure}

    \caption{Dimer excited state energies predicted by full dimer TD-DFT (left)

    dimer geometries with one monomer rotated around the $Q_x$ axis.}
    \label{fig:chl_xtb_rot_Qx}
\end{figure}

In this case where there is little random error from geometry variation, the exciton
model rather than Chl-xTB properties is most likely the leading cause of error. 
This does not contradict the LH2 dimer conclusion as these setups test two different
things. For LH2 dimers, the exciton model had to predict correct variations in transition
properties for a set of intra-chromophore geometries, similar to the study in the 
previous chapter. The range of inter-chromophore conformations is fairly narrow,
especially for nearest neighbours. In contrast, in this study the intra-chromophore 
geometry is constant, and the inter-chromophore geometry is changed. Using static 
monomer geometries removes the compound issue between Chl-xTB and CAM-B3LYP monomer
properties being different for intra-chromophore geometries, and just focuses on 
whether a non-varying Chl-xTB transition can supply decent properties for a varying 
dimer system. One observation that showcased this difference is in the coupling 
values, which were predicted much larger than CAM-B3LYP analogues in earlier versions
of chl-xTB. Observing that the transition dipoles were also much larger in these 
earlier versions of Chl-xTb, an artifact also observed in \dscf and the eigenvalue
difference methods of the previous chapters, the transition density matrix scaling 
factor was then included. Without removing the variation due to intra-chromophore 
geometry this effect may not have been clear.

As the exciton framework has been shown to break down at small separations, it was
postulated that there should be a good correlation between proximity of electron
density and errors in predicting excited states. The places where the two chlorophylls
would have a closest approach would be in the functional groups attached to the 
porphyrin ring. The centres of functional groups which have the most amount of transition
density are shown in figure \ref{fig:dimer_system} with orange spheres. These atoms
were used to calculate the maximum reciprocal distance between the chlorophylls, 
which would correspond to the leading terms in the exciton coupling elements.

As the energy value of the excited states is very different between CAM-B3LYP and
Chl-xTB, a better comparison would be in the error of transition energies from the
ground exciton state to the excited states, taken as the difference between the 
states. The profile of the sums of the absolute values of the error in these two
transitions along the angle of rotation, alongside the reciprocal distance of the
closest functional groups on the porphyrin ring is shown in figures \ref{fig:error_along_qz}, 
\ref{fig:error_along_qx} and \ref{fig:error_along_qy}. It can be clearly seen that
peaks in error in transition energy correspond with peaks in the proximity of the
functional groups. It would be expected that a better approximation of electron 
interaction at close separations, such as the MNOK integrals used in the previous
chapter, would improve the behaviour in these regions, but these issues are not 
in the scope of this work. As stated earlier, these separations are artificially 
small to exacerbate differences for clearer observation. Additionally the errors 
in transition energies are on the order of miliHartree, well within a reasonable
range of other functionals.

Both the accuracy in monomer properties, as well a chemically meaningful formalism
has enabled Chl-xTB exciton frameworks to be perform well when compared against
TD-DFT methods. Alternative approaches based on a similar semi-empirical approach,
such as using sTDA-xTB to predict exciton transition energies, are outperformed 
by this framework. Transition energies for the LH2 dimer test-set from section \ref{subsec:LH2_exciton_camb3lyp}
were calculated using sTDA-xTB for chlorophyll monomer transition properties. Only
a point-dipole coupling method was available with this framework, as transition 
densities or atom-resolved transition charges are not readily accessible. These
energies are shown in figure \ref{fig:dimer_w_stda}.

\section{Prediction of the Rate of Electron Transfer in Concentration Quenching}
\label{sec:concentration_quenching}
 
Efficiently calculating exciton network energies opens new avenues of modelling 
LHC properties. With more efficient and accurate calculations, coordinate spaces 
with large numbers of degrees of freedom can be confidently sampled, extracting 
the underlying chemical and physical structures that define features in these spaces.
More specifically, utilizing the enhanced sampling that Chl-xTB provides has enabled
mapping energy surfaces of embedded chlorophyll dimer states, where the dimers are
actively affected by the surrounding solvent (evidenced by the discrepancy in fluorescence 
quenching seen in solvated chlorophyll and chlorophyll networks in LH2 \cite{Watson1950}). 
From these surfaces the rate constants of the proposed mechanism for fluorescence 
quenching can be predicted and systematically varied with solvent and protein environment. 
It should be noted that the high number of degrees of freedom in these surfaces 
directly originate from the effect of environment on chlorophyll geometry conformation,
giving two important considerations: a systematic scan of a reaction coordinate 
would not be possible, due to the sheer number of atoms involved; accurate construction
of these surfaces require the three main benefits of the Chl-xTB framework 
(efficiency, accuracy, and inclusion of embedding effects).

The rate constant of electron transfer from the ES to CS state is dependent on the
free energy change $\Delta A$ and reorganization energy $\lambda$ of said transition,
and is given by

\begin{equation}
    k_{\text{CS}} = \frac{2\pi}{\hbar} \left\lvert H_{AB} \right\rvert^2 \frac{1}{\sqrt{4 \pi \lambda k_B T}}\text{exp}\left(\frac{-\left(\lambda + \Delta A\right)^2}{4 \lambda k_B T}\right)
\end{equation}
%
where $H_{AB}$ is the coupling value between the ES and CS states, $k_B$ is the 
usual Boltzmann constant and $T$ is the temperature. $\Delta A$ and $\lambda$ are
calculated from the minima of the ES and CS free energy surfaces (FESs). Due to
the dependence of these surfaces on both the internal geometry of the dimers and
the surrounding solvent system, it is not possible to discern a simple reaction 
coordinate to perform systematic scans. Instead, the FES can be reconstructed from 
a distribution of energy values, calculated from a large volume of stochastic chlorophyll 
dimer geometries.

Calculating FESs was done for a series of chlorophyll dimers, using the difference
between the ES and CS energies as the reaction coordinate. This coordinate space
would include all of the internal chlorophyll coordinates and solvent coordinates. 
The FESs was assumed to be a quadratic function of the excitation energy $\Delta E$

\begin{equation}
    V\left(\Delta E\right) = \frac{kT}{2} \left( \frac{\Delta E - \mu}{\sigma}\right)^2
\end{equation}
%
where $\mu$ and $\sigma$ are the mean and standard deviation of the excitation energies.
Assuming the FESs are quadratic is consistent with studies on bacteriochlorophyll 
pairs in the photosynthetic reaction centre of \emph{Rb. Sphaeroides} \cite{Warshel2001}.
The Boltzmann distribution from this FES is a normal distribution

\begin{equation}
    P\left(\Delta E\right) = \text{exp} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\Delta E - \mu}{\sigma}\right)^2\right)
    \label{eq:FES_normdist}
\end{equation}
%
and so values for $\mu$ and $\sigma$ also define the FES. 

The rate $k_{ES \rightarrow CS}$ was calculated for a series of chlorophyll dimers 
at a constant separation, with MD simulations used to generate thermally distributed
geometries of the dimer systems. The work by Beddard and Porter demonstrated that
a critical distance of $\sim 10$ \AA{} is required to chlorophyll dimer to start
exhibiting the charge-separation trap states proposed for quenching \cite{Beddard1976b}.
In this way, a constraint was used to keep a dimer pair at a constant separation 
in order to properly inspect the effect of chlorophyll distance on the charge separation
rate. These constraints were set to 8, 10, 12, 14 and 20 \AA{}. For each separation,
the dimer systems were explicitly solvated with 100 \AA{} diethyl ether boxes. These
boxes were prepared using \code{Packmol}, and force-field parameters were taken
from OpenForceField version 1.3.0. Each system was equilibrated for 10 ps at 300 K
with a Langevin Integrator, with a production simulation of 500 ps performed afterwards. 

A $k_{ES \rightarrow CS}$ rate  was also calculated for a pair of chlorophylls embedded
in the LH2 protein. The average separation of nearest neighbours in LH2 is $\sim 9$ \AA{}.
The LH2 geometries were generated using the same MD method as the diethyl ether 
systems, but using the LH2 structure and force-field developed by Ramos \emph{et al.} \cite{Mennucci2019}.
For both sets of environments, snapshots were taken every 1 ps for 500 total geometries. 

Dimer excited states were calculated for all of the geometries, using the Frenkel
exciton Hamiltonian and Chl-xTB. To account for environmental effects, the solvent
and other chlorophyll(s) were included in point charges interactions (with charge
values taken from the force-fields used) to polarize the Chl-xTB calculations. Means 
$\mu$ and standard deviations $\sigma$ of the symmetric normal distribution in equation
\ref{eq:FES_normdist} were fit to the series of lowest energy exciton states, to
reconstruct the FES. Fitting $\mu$ and $\sigma$ was done with the \code{scipy.stats} 
module. Good fits were achieved with this method, justifying the assumption that 
the FESs follow a quadratic form.

The coupling value $H_{AB} = \braket{ES|\hat{H}|CS}$ was calculated for a set of
dimers using Fragment Orbital DFT with a PBE/3-21++G level of theory. FODFT will
become less accurate as the distances between fragments get larger due to basis
set truncation errors, so instead of calculating separate values for all separations
the 10 $\AA{}$ case was used to better approximate further separations using an
exponential decay. Additionally, truncated chlorophylls with the phytol tail removed
were used to make the FODFT calculations feasible.

The rate constant calculated for the $10\AA{}$ angstrom dimer, in diethyl ether,
was calculated to be $0.03 \text{ns}^{-1}$ $\pm 0.01 \text{ns}^{-1}$. As the fluorescence
rate $k_f$ is given as 0.2 $\text{ns}^{-1}$ \cite{Brody2002}, charge separation
is a competitive pathway for quenching vertically excited states. The $0.03 \text{ns}^{-1}$
value also assumes a full relaxation of the geometries to a new equilibrium. Taking
values for $\Delta A$ and $\lambda$ from the reaction coordinate at initial photoexcitation 
(i.e. where the ground state dimer distribution would sit) gives a more competitive 
rate constant of $0.04 \text{ns}^{-1}$. Other considerations also suggest the rate
constant calculated with this method will be an underestimate, making it even more competitive.

The rate constant also decreases with the distance between the chlorophyll dimers, as can
be seen in the increase in $\lambda$ and $\Delta A$ values for 8 $\AA{}$, 10 $\AA{}$,
12 $\AA{}$, 14 $\AA{}$ and 20 $\AA{}$ shown in figure \ref{fig:ct_pes_distance}. 
As the systems become more separated and both $\Delta A$ and $\lambda$ increase, 
the rate constant is reduced exponentially. This is contrary to the previously held
assumption that there is a critical distance where this rate drops to zero \cite{Beddard1976},
although the exponential drop off in rate will be sharp. Additionally, the coupling
value $H_{AB}$ will also decrease with distance. This decrease is due to the dependence 
on overlap between the donor and acceptor orbitals in the electron transfer, which 
decreases with distance again exponentially.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.4]{../../Year_3/CT_figures/PES_by_step.png}
    \caption{Free energy surfaces of the charge separated and vertical excitation
    states of chlorophyll dimer systems, using the difference in state energies 
    as the coordinate, for a series of separations. Free energy changes ($\Delta A$)
    and reorganization energies ($\lambda$) are shown for each separation.}
    \label{fig:ct_pes_distance}
\end{figure}

Comparing the constrained systems to the LH2 system reveals how the protein structure
biases the rate constant to be even lower. The average separation of chlorophylls
in the LH2 system is around 9 $\AA{}$, which below the separation for formation
of what is termed statistical pairs, where transition to the CS state is most competitive\cite{Beddard1976b}.
However, as can been seen in figure \ref{fig:ct_pes_lh2}, the free energy change
is much higher for LH2 than for even the 20 $\AA{}$ case, attributed to a destabilization
of the CS state. Additionally, the crossing point for the electron transfer is to
the right of the CS state minima, implying that any transition from ES to CS would
quickly reverse. This biasing of FESs illustrates how the LH2 protein scaffold actively
reduces the rate constant for quenching which would otherwise be present at such
close separations.

    states of LH2 chlorophyll dimer systems, using the same coordinate as figure

    charge separation state FES minimum to the left-hand side of the vertical excitation 
    FES imply the LH2 protein environment inhibits transfer to the charge separated
    state.}

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:exciton_concs}

It has been shown that a Frenkel exciton Hamiltonian constructed using Chl-xTB can
give reliable transition properties for aggregate chlorophyll systems. Whilst some
issues were found in benchmarking against relevant PBE0 data, comparisons to CAM-B3LYP 
were still possible and showcase the accuracy of the Chl-xTB exciton method. The
quantitative accuracy of transition energies for LH2 dimers is on the order expected
from the training data. As Chl-xTB and PBE0 based excitons predict CAM-B3LYP data
with similar levels of accuracy, it is not expected that improvements to Chl-xTB
optimization methods would have appreciable effect in this specific test. The qualitative
trends in excited state energies for artificial dimer geometries imply that Chl-xTB 
excitons can predict variations due to geometry changes well, advantageous to the
main focus of this work.

It can be seen how Chl-xTB design choices have created a method that can be readily 
applied to light harvesting systems. For this work, Chl-xTB had to be shown to be 
able to predict transition properties for a range of LH2 dimer conformations, but 
no explicit consideration is given to other systems. The qualitative trends found 
in the dimer geometry scans imply that this method would work for other light harvesting
complexes. However one outcome of benchmarking other systems could be that the training
data range would need to be extended, similar to the conclusion of the previous 
chapter. Some of the errors in the Chl-xTB exciton model may be improved by using
other monomer interaction methods beyond the point charge interaction, such as
using MNOK operators similar to the work done in the previous chapter, although
with different parameters.

The benefits of the efficient Chl-xTB exciton method is illustrated in predicting
the rate constants of transitions between excited states in chlorophyll dimers. 
This study has provided  predictions of quenching mechanisms rates in chlorophyll
dimers that take into effect the atomistic properties of the LH2 protein scaffold.
By including these effects it has been demonstrated that the protein scaffold biases 
against charge-separation quenching pathways when compared to dimers in solution
phase, a clear indication of how the LH2 complex maximizes beneficial EET. As a 
case study, the application of the Chl-xTB exciton method demonstrates its potential
uses for light harvesting studies that may not be feasible with other excited state
methods. Similar to the arguments in section \ref{sec:chl_conclusions}, it is the 
ability to bootstrap high level data that is a main benefit of this kind of method.
