\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chap:intro}

\initial {N}aturally occuring light harvesting systems present an interesting 
scientific challenge. With near perfect efficiency\cite{Scholes2011}, the energy 
from a photon will be absorbed and transferred to a reaction centre, leading to 
charge transfer processes that culminate in powering biological systems. Constructing 
models that can predict and explain these effects are key to making similarly efficient 
photovoltaic systems.

\section{Electronic structure}
\label{sec:electronic_structure}

\subsection{Density Functional Theory}
\label{subsec:dft}

Density functional theory (DFT) is ubiquitous in electronic structure calculations.
Its' application to a wide range of system sizes as well as chemical systems make 
it an ideal choice for many situations, including chlorophyll and light harvesting
systems. A brief overview of DFT is given here to contextualise its use for 

At its heart DFT is based on the two Hohenberg-Kohn theorems. The first states that
the ground state energy $E_{\text{GS}}$, is proven to have a one-to-one mapping 
to a functional of the electron density $\rho_{\text{GS}} \left(r\right)$

\begin{equation}
    E_{\text{GS}} = E \left[ \rho_{\text{GS}} \left(r\right)\right]
\end{equation}

where $E \left[ \rho_{\text{GS}} \left(r\right)\right]$ is the functional. The second
theorem is closely related to the variation principle, stating that the \emph{exact}
ground state density also minimises the total energy. This minima corresponds to 
only one electron density. Whilst proven in principle, the exact functional of the
electron density is unknown and so various approximations have be made. One popular
method is the Kohn-Sham approach, where non-interacting electrons are used to generate
the ground state density.  The total energy in the Kohn-Sham approach is the sum
of functionals

\begin{equation}
    \functional{E}{\text{tot}}{\rho} = \functional{E}{T_S}{\rho} + \functional{E}{V}{\rho} + \functional{E}{J}{\rho} + \functional{E}{X}{\rho} + \functional{E}{C}{\rho}
\end{equation}

where these terms correspond to the kinetic, (nuclear) potential, bare Coulombic,
exchange and correlation interaction respectively. Due to the Coulombic approximation
not including spin effects, it is necessary to include the exchange and correlation
terms. The solution for the minimum energy would satisfy

\begin{equation}
    \Delta \left[  \functional{E}{\text{tot}}{\rho}  - \mu \left( \int_{}^{} \rho\left(r\right) \,dr - N \right) \right] = 0
\end{equation}

with the constraint that the total number of electrons $N$ is conserved. The value
of $\mu$ is given by

\begin{equation}
    \mu = \frac{\delta  \functional{E}{\text{tot}}{\rho}}{\delta \rho}
\end{equation}

which can be rewritten in terms of the kinetic energy and energy potentials

\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        \mu &= \frac{\delta  \functional{E}{T_S}{\rho}}{\delta \rho} + \functional{v}{V}{\rho} + \functional{v}{J}{\rho} + \functional{v}{X}{\rho} + \functional{v}{C}{\rho} \\
            &= \frac{\delta  \functional{E}{T_S}{\rho}}{\delta \rho} + \functional{v}{KS}{\rho}
    \end{split}
\end{equation}

where the energy potentials are combined into the Kohn-Sham potential $\functional{v}{KS}{\rho}$ for
convenience. As the electrons are non-interacting, this potential can be used to
solve one-electron Schr√∂dinger equations

\begin{equation}
    \left[ -\frac{1}{2} \nabla^2 + \functional{v}{KS}{\rho} \right] \psi_i = \epsilon_i \psi_i
\end{equation}

where $psi_i$ are one-electron wavefunctions, $\epsilon_i$ are Lagrange multipliers
to ensure orthonormality, and the kinetic energy term $-\frac{1}{2} \nabla ^2$ is
given from the definition of the kinetic energy of non-interacting electrons

\begin{equation}
    \functional{E}{T_S}{\rho} = -\frac{1}{2} \sum_i^N \braket{\psi_i|\nabla^2|\psi_i}
\end{equation}

. The total electron density can be constructed from the one-electron wavefunction
solutions

\begin{equation}
    \rho = \sum_i^N \left\lvert \psi_i \right( r \left)^2 \right\rvert 
\end{equation}

. Again the issue is that the potential functional $\functional{v}{KS}{\rho}$ is
not known, and so approximations have to be made. Additionally, an initial guess 
of the electron density in needed to start the variational procedure, but this can
readily be given from atomic densities or other methods.

\subsection{Semi-Empirical Methods}
\label{subsec:xtb_theory}

\subsubsection{Tight Binding}
\label{subsubsec:tight_binding}
In recent years there has been renewed interest in tight-binding methods, including
tight binding methods derived from density functional theory (named density function 
tight binding or DFTB)\cite{Porezag1994}. These methods approximate the density 
functional energy by expanding it into a Taylor series based on the density fluctuations
$\delta\rho$\cite{Koskinen2009}

\begin{equation}
E\left[\rho\right] \approx E^{\left(0\right)}\left[\rho_0\right] + E^{\left(1\right)}\left[\rho_0, \delta\rho\right] + E^{\left(2\right)}\left[\rho_0, \left(\delta\rho\right)^2\right] + E^{\left(3\right)}\left[\rho_0, \left(\delta\rho\right)^3\right] + \dots
\end{equation}

This series is usually truncated at somewhere between the first and third term\cite{Gaus2011}. 
Additionally, it is assumed these density fluctuations will only occur in the valence 
orbitals of a system, and so core atomic orbitals do not need explicit treatment. 
As such, these methods usually will use a minimal valence basis set\cite{Bannwarth2020}.

Tight binding methods are usually turned to in investigations where the scale of 
the system of interest is too large for more usual methods, such as DFT or Hartree-Fock 
(HF) based methods, to be used. Previous methods of dealing with the size of these 
systems has been to turn to force-field methods, which do not use any quantum mechanical 
methods and only use classical methods to evaluate energies and gradients of systems. 
However, it has routinely been shown that these are inaccurate for many systems 
that involve proton transfer or metallic centers or the making and breaking of chemical 
bonds\cite{Salomon-Ferrer2013}, which unfortunately covers many interesting biochemical 
systems, photosynthesis included. For these systems then, using tight-binding methods 
seems to be a good tradeoff between the expense of full DFT methods and the innacuracies 
of classical methods. However, work on making DFT method quicker, usually with efficient 
massively parallelized codes, is closing the gap where DFTB methods exist\cite{Manathunga2020}.

\subsubsection{Empirical Fitting}
\label{subsubsec:empirical_fitting}

Whilst there is nothing inherent about tight binding methods that require emperically 
fit parameters, it is usual to make further efficiency gains by using fitted terms 
for some energy functions. Usually these parameters are fit to certain classes of 
systems, such as proteins or metallic system, to minimize the drop in accuracy. 
Additionally, many methods have to make use of element pairwise parameters\cite{Bannwarth2020}, 
which can sometimes reduce the cases where each method would be reliable (eg a copper-carbon 
interaction will be very different in biological systems compared to an inorganic system, 
such that usually metalloproteins have to be parameterized completely separately).

\subsubsection{xTB Methods}
\label{subsubsec:xtb_methods}

Recently the extended tight binding (xTB) family of methods, developed by the Grimme 
group, have been presented as another semi-empirical tight binding solution to investigating 
large chemical systems\cite{Bannwarth2020}\cite{Bannwarth2019}\cite{Grimme2017}\cite{Pracht2019}\cite{Grimme2016}\cite{Spicher2020a}.
Many of these methods have been parameterized for geometry optimizations and frequencies 
of normal modes, as well as to take into account non-covalent interactions, hence 
many of them have the prefix GFN for geometries, frequencies and non-covalent. These 
methods hope to solve the element pair-wise parameterization problem whilst also 
remaining efficient and accurate for large systems. These methods also explore the 
large range of electronic structure treatments that can be done by tight binding 
methods. For example, GFN2 uses the greatest detail for electronic structure, with 
a multipole (up to quadrupole) expansion for electrostatics, that along with a detailed 
dispersion method lets GFN2 be completely pairwise parameter free. GFN0 and GFN-FF (a forcefield method) on the other hand, use very approximate methods and many more parameters to increase speed and possible size of systems.

The energy terms for xTB methods can be characterized by the order of density fluctuations 
they correspond to. For example, the zeroth order terms are given by dispersion 
(either D3\cite{Grimme2010}, D4\cite{Caldeweyher2020} or a modified D4 method) and
electronic repulsion interactions, as well as a halogen bonding correction. First 
order terms are usually given by an extended Huckel theory, which will be discussed 
later. The second and higher order terms are given by isotropic electrostatic and 
exchange-correlation terms.

Hence we can give a brief description of the GFN-xTB energies as

\newcommand{\orderE}[2]{E^{\left(#1\right)}_{#2}}
\newcommand{\nameE}[2]{E^{#1}_{#2}}
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
E_{\text{GFN1-xTB}} &= \orderE{0}{\text{disp}} + \orderE{0}{\text{rep}} + \orderE{0}{\text{XB}} + \orderE{1}{\text{EHT}} + \orderE{2}{\text{IES+IXC}} + \orderE{3}{\text{IES+IXC}} \\
&= \nameE{\text{D3}}{\text{disp}} + \nameE{}{\text{rep}} + \nameE{\text{GFN1}}{\text{XB}} + \nameE{}{\text{EHT}} + \nameE{}{\gamma} + \nameE{\text{GFN1}}{\Gamma}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
E_{\text{GFN2-xTB}} &= \orderE{0,1,2}{\text{disp}} + \orderE{0}{\text{rep}} + \orderE{1}{\text{EHT}}  + \orderE{2}{\text{IES+IXC}} + \orderE{2}{\text{AES+AXC}} + \orderE{3}{\text{IES+IXC}} \\
&= \nameE{\text{D4'}}{\text{disp}} + \nameE{}{\text{rep}} + \nameE{}{\text{EHT}}  + \nameE{}{\gamma} + \nameE{}{AXC} + \nameE{\text{GFN2}}{\Gamma}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
E_{\text{GFN0-xTB}} &= \orderE{0}{\text{disp}} + \orderE{0}{\text{rep}} + \orderE{1}{\text{EHT}}  + \Delta\orderE{0}{} \\
&= \nameE{\text{D4}}{\text{disp}} + \nameE{}{\text{rep}} + \nameE{}{\text{EHT}}  + \nameE{}{\text{EEQ}} + \nameE{}{\text{srb}}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

where the subscripts generally describe the interaction each term is describing. 
$\text{disp}$ and $\text{rep}$ account for dispersion and repulsion interactions, 
a zeroth order term with respect to density fluctuations. $\text{EHT}$ is the extend 
Huckel theory, which is first order. $\text{IES}$, $\text{IXC}$ and $\text{AES}$, 
$\text{AXC}$ are isotropic electrostatics and exchange-correlation effects and anisotropic 
electrostatics and exchange-correlation respectively, which are second and third 
order terms. $\text{XB}$ is a hydrogen bonding correction. Many of these then have 
corresponding terms in the xTB theories (ie $\orderE{0}{\text{disp}}$ is given by 
the D3 energy $E^{D3}_{\text{disp}}$). 

Common to all of these expressions is the extended Huckel theory energy term, which 
deals with first order density fluctuations. This energy is given by tracing a Hamiltonian 
$H_{\mu\nu}^{\text{EHT}}$ constructed from extended Huckel theory with the valence 
one-electron density $P_{\mu\nu}$

\begin{equation}
E_{\text{EHT}} = \sum_{\mu\nu} P_{\mu\nu} H_{\mu\nu}^{\text{EHT}}
\end{equation}

where $\mu$, $\nu$ are the indices of atomic orbitals. The elements of the Hamiltonian 
are given by the general equation

\begin{equation}
H_{\mu\nu}^{\text{EHT}} = \frac{1}{2} K_{AB}^{ll'}S_{\mu\nu}\left(H_{\mu\mu} + H_{\nu\nu}\right)X\left(EN_A, EN_B\right)\Pi\left(R_{AB}, l, l'\right)Y\left(\eta^A_l\eta^B_{l'}\right)
\end{equation}

where $A,B$ are atomic indices, and $l,l'$ are the indices of atomic orbitals on 
atoms $A, B$ respectively (ie $l \in A, l' \in B$). $K$ is a parameterized global 
scaling term, $S$ is the atomic orbital overlap. $H$ are diagonal elements of the 
Hamiltonian and deal with on-site energies. $X$ is a function of the environment-scaled 
electro-negativity $EN$, $\Pi$ is another distance-dependent function, to correct 
for the distance-scaled interactions from the overlap matrix. $Y$ is the identity 
matrix for GFN1-xTB, but corrects for kinetic energy integrals in GFN2- and GFN0-xTB. 
Due to the lack of element pair-wise parameters (except for a few special cases 
in the global scaling constants), these terms are readily separable and so can either 
be considered or discarded for future parameterization work. For example, the $\Pi$,
$Y$ and $X$ term deal with interactions that are more described by atomic environments 
rather than particular chemistry between atoms. Hence, for excited state theories they 
would not really have to be changed. This is corroborated by their absence in the 
Hamiltonian for the simplified Tamm-Dancoff (sTDA) xTB\cite{Grimme2016} method, 
which is discussed later.

In the GFN1 and GFN2 methods there are also the $E_\gamma$ and $E_\Gamma^{\text{GFNn}}$ 
terms, which are the energy terms from second and third order density fluctuations. 
The second order term, $E_\gamma$ is common to GFN1 and GFN2, and is given by

\begin{equation}
E_\gamma = \frac{1}{2} \sum^{N}_{A,B} \sum_{l \in A} \sum_{l' \in B} q_l q_{l'} \gamma_{AB, ll'}
\end{equation}

wherer $q_l$ are shell-resolved Mulliken partial charges, $A,B$ are atom indices 
and $l,l'$ are shell indices. The $\gamma$ operator describes short-range Coulombic 
interactions:

\begin{equation}
\gamma_{AB, ll'} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{R^2_{AB} + \eta^{-2}_{AB, ll'}}}
\end{equation}

where $R_{AB}$ is the internuclear distance between A and B, and $\eta$ is a parameterized 
chemical hardness. The third order term is slightly different for GFN1 and GFN2,
 ut are generally given by

\begin{equation}
E_\Gamma = \frac{1}{3}\sum_A^N q_A^3 \Gamma_A
\end{equation}

where $q_A$ is the atom partial charge (sum of the shell partial charges on that atom), 
and $\Gamma_A$ is a different operator constructed from atomwise parameters. The relevance 
of these terms is that they show how many expensive integrals can be approximated 
sucessfully with a cheaper partial charge interaction.

\section{Light-Matter Response Methods}
\label{sec:response_theories}

\subsection{Linear Response}
\label{subsec:tddft}

Linear response TDDFT is a well established method for calculating excitation energies
and transition properties from only ground state information. It is formulated 
from the Runge-Gross theorem\cite{Runge1984}, which shows how the time dependent 
density of a system can be mapped from the time-dependent external potential (for 
light-matter interactions, the external potential is the light wave), and this 
mapping is unique. Usually when talking about TDDFT we go one step further, and 
approximate the response of the electron density to the external potential as a 
linear perturbation\cite{Marques2004}. This is very useful as only the ground state
is needed to calculate perturbations to the first order, meaning that all transition
properties can be calculated from the ground state\cite{Marques2004}.

Response theory aims to predict the changes in the electronic structure of a molecule 
when exposed to an external electronic potential. This is described by the Hamiltonian

\begin{equation}
\hat{H}\left(t\right) = \hat{H^0} + V^{\text{ext}}\left(t\right)
\end{equation}

where $\hat{H^0}$ is the unpeturbed Hamiltonian, $V^{\text{ext}}\left(t\right)$ 
is the potential from the external field, which is usually taken to be an oscillating 
electric field and so is time $t$ dependent. This Hamiltonian can then be used to 
describe a time-dependent set of Kohn-Sham equations\cite{Kohn1952}. For example 
the time-dependent Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian is given by

\begin{equation}
\hat{H}_{KS}\left[\rho\right]\left(t\right) = \hat{H}^0_{KS}\left[\rho\right] + V_H\left[\rho\right]\left(t\right) + V_{\text{XC}}\left[\rho\right]\left(t\right) + V^{\text{ext}}\left(t\right)
\end{equation} 

where $\rho$ is the electron density, $\left[\rho\right]$ denotes a density functional. 
$V_H$ and $V_{XC}$ are the Kohn-Sham coloumb and exchange-correlation potentials 
respectively. The key part of the Runge-Gross theorm is that the density solution 
to this Hamiltonian can be uniquely mapped from the potential function, and so the 
time-dependent density can be written as a function of the potential function

\begin{equation}
\rho\left(t\right) = \rho\left[V^{\text{ext}}\right]\left(t\right)
\end{equation}

. As stated above, linear response theory makes a Taylor expansion of this time-dependent 
density, and approximates the full sum by only the first term

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\rho\left(t\right) &= \rho_0 + \rho_1\left(t\right) + \rho_2\left(t\right) + \dots \\
&\approx \rho_0 + \rho_1\left(t\right)
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

where $\rho_n\left(t\right)$ is the density response to the $n$-th order. There 
re several steps that are easier to speed through here. One of these steps is that 
the time-dependent term is only dependent on time differences, and so can be transformed 
with a Fourier transform. Second is that the poles (ie where the inverse of the 
function is zero) of the response function give the excitation energies. These,
along with more technical details, lead to the full Cassida equation:

\begin{equation}
\label{full_cassida_eq1}
\left(\begin{matrix}
\mathbf{A} & \mathbf{B} \\
\mathbf{B^*} & \mathbf{A^*}
\end{matrix}\right)
\left(\begin{matrix}
\mathbf{X}\\
\mathbf{Y}
\end{matrix}\right)
=
\left(\begin{matrix}
\omega & 0\\
0 & -\omega
\end{matrix}\right)
\left(\begin{matrix}
\mathbf{X}\\
\mathbf{Y}
\end{matrix}\right)
\end{equation}

where $\omega$ are the excitation energies, and the vectors $\mathbf{X}$ and $\mathbf{Y}$ 
describe the electronic transitions in the basis of ground state molecular orbitals. 
The elements of matrices $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ are derived from Fourier 
transformed density, and are explicitly given by

\begin{equation}
A_{ia,jb}\left(\omega\right) = \delta_{ij}\delta_{ab}\left(\epsilon_a - \epsilon_i\right) + \int dr_1 \int dr_2 \psi_i^*\left(r_1\right) \psi_a\left(r_1\right) f_{\text{XC}}\left(r_1, r_2, \omega\right) \psi_i\left(r_2\right) \psi_a^*\left(r_2\right)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
B_{ia,jb}\left(\omega\right) = \int dr \int dr' \psi_i^*\left(r_1\right) \psi_a\left(r_1\right) f_{\text{XC}}\left(r_1, r_2, \omega\right) \psi_i\left(r_2\right) \psi_a^*\left(r_2\right)
\end{equation}

where $r$ is the position of the electron in orbitals $\psi$, and $i$,$j$ and $a$, 
$b$ are occupied and virtual orbital indices respectively. $\epsilon_p$ are the 
orbital energies the ground state orbitals, and $\delta$ is the usual kronecker 
delta function. The kernal function $f_{\text{XC}}$ is an exact frequency (excitation energy) 
dependent exchange-correlation functional, and as it is dependent on the excitation 
energy given by the solutions of this eigenvalue equation, can be seen to be self-consistent.

However, approximations can be made. First is that the coupling matrix elements 
are in fact zero. Hence the excitation energies are just the eigenvalue differences, 
giving the eigenvalue difference method discussed below. Second is to say that the 
kernal function is actually frequency independent. This can then give the matrix 
elements in a more computable form. These could be calculated by any density functional 
theory (DFT) method - for example if using a mix of generalized gradient approximation 
(GGA) density functional and exact exchange, the matrix elements would be given 
by

\begin{equation}
A_{ia, jb} = \delta_{ij} \delta_{ab} \left(\epsilon_a - \epsilon_i \right) + \left(ia|jb\right) - \zeta\left(ij|ab\right) + \left(1-\zeta\right)\left(ia|f_{\text{XC}}|jb\right)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
B_{ia, jb} = \left(ia|jb\right) - \zeta\left(ij|ab\right) + \left(1-\zeta\right)\left(ia|f_{\text{XC}}|jb\right)
\end{equation}

where spatial notation has been used for brevity. $\zeta$ here is the amount of 
exact exchange mixing. The density functional term $\left(ia|f_{\text{XC}}|jb\right)$ 
is given by

\begin{equation}
\left(ia|f_{\text{XC}}|jb\right) = \int dr_1 \int dr_2 \psi_i \left(r_1\right)\psi_a \left(r_1\right) \frac{\delta^2 E^{\text{GGA}_{\text{XC}}}}{\delta\rho\left(r_1\right)\delta\rho\left(r_2\right)} \psi_i \left(r_2\right)\psi_a \left(r_2\right)
\end{equation}

It is known that some density functionals are better than others for this approximation. 
Recently a benchmarking of different density functionals for the \Qy transitions 
in chlorophylls showed that the lowest error is around 0.1 eV \cite{List2013}. TDDFT 
has become the work-horse of excitated state studies. It is on comparable accuracy 
to higher level methods, such as coupled cluster methods, but without the expence\cite{Laurent2013} 
and can be calculated from just ground state information within the linear response 
approximation. However, as stated earlier, the excited state gradients are still 
expensive to calculate, especially for the large LH2 system.

\subsection{$\Delta$-SCF}
\label{subsec{dscf_and_eigdiff}}

\dscf predicts the transition energy $\Delta E$ of a system as the difference of
the single point energy $E_n$ of two states:

\begin{equation}
\Delta E = E_{2} - E_{1}
\end{equation}
%
It is usually assumed that the excited state solution will be in a similar
location to the ground state in the MO coefficient space. The ground state MO 
coefficients are usually used for an initial guess for the excited
state for this reason. In its simplest form, the \dscf method calculates
the ground state with normal DFT or other mean-field methods, and
then calculates the excited state by rerunning the same method with the excited
state occupation numbers. The two sets of MO coefficients give a full description
of both the ground as excited state.

The issue with finding the excited state solution is that the variation principle
and SCF iterative procedure will try to find the global minimum, which is the 
ground state. The excited state is a local minimum, and so often is less reliable
to find as a solution, especially from the standard SAD initial guess.
For this reason it is often found that converging to the \dscf excited state will
fail. Even when using the ground state as an initial guess with excited state
occupations, normal SCF procedure may still collapse back to the ground state.
Usually it is necessary to include additional changes to the SCF procedure,
such as Fock damping, alternative DIIS methods and sometimes intermediate 
initial guess steps.

Initially, the excited state was calculated by relaxing the orbitals which
contain the excited electron and hole in the ground state space, so that the
excited state and ground state are orthogonal \cite{Hunt1969}. However, it was
argued that this procedure would exacerbate the likelihood of collapsing to the ground
state, and that the excited state was not a proper SCF solution \cite{Gilbert2008}.
Alternatively, an SCF like method was proposed, where instead of
populating orbitals according to the Aufbau principle, orbitals which most
resemble the previous iteration's orbitals should be occupied. This is known as 
the maximum overlap method (MOM). In the maximum overlap method, each iteration 
in an SCF procedure produces new molecular orbital coefficients by solving the 
Roothaan-Hall equations \cite{Roothaan1951}, generally given as an eigenvalue problem:

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{F} \mathbf{C}^{\text{n}} = \mathbf{S} \mathbf{C}^{\text{n}} \epsilon
\label{eq:roothaan_hall}
\end{equation}
%
where $\mathbf{C}^{\text{n}}$ are the $n^{\text{th}}$ orbital coefficient solutions, 
$\mathbf{S}$ is the overlap of orbtials, and $\epsilon$ are the orbital energies. 
The Fock matrix $\mathbf{F}$ is calculated from the previous set of orbital 
coefficients,

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{F} = f\left(\mathbf{C}^{n-1}\right)
\end{equation}
%
. The amount of similarity of orbitals can be estimated from their overlap,

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{O} = \left(\mathbf{C}^{\text{old}}\right)^\dagger \mathbf{S} \mathbf{C}^{\text{new}}
\end{equation}
%
and for a single orbital can be evaluated as a projection,

\begin{equation}
p_j = \sum^n_i O_{ij} = \sum^N_\nu \left[\sum^N_\mu\left(\sum^n_i C_{i\mu}^{\text{old}}\right)S_{\mu\nu}\right]C^{\text{new}}_{\nu j}
\end{equation}
%
where $\mu,\nu$ are orbital indices. the set of orbitals with the highest projection
$p_j$ are then populated with electrons.  This method can be used for any
excited state, with the caveat that the orbital solution will most likely be in
the same region as the ground state solution. For a small number of low lying states,
this is generally  true, and so \dscf can be used to calculate a small spectrum of
excited states \cite{Gilbert2008}.

\dscf has been shown to be cheap alternative to TD-DFT and other higher level
methods \cite{Liu2004, Gavnholt2008, Besley2009}, without considerable losses of
accuracy in certain cases, especially for HOMO-LUMO transitions \cite{Kowalczyk2011}.
Additionally, as the excited state is given as solutions to SCF equations,
the gradient of this solution can be given by normal mean-field theory.
These gradients would be much cheaper than TD-DFT or coupled cluster methods, 
which is advantageous for simulatings dynamics \cite{Gavnholt2008}.

\subsection{Eigenvalue Difference}
\label{subsec:eigval_diff}
Another approximation to full response theory is the eigenvalue difference method. 
Here there is assumed to be no response of the orbital energies and shapes when 
interacting with light. This would be recovered from the complete Cassida equation
if the coupling elements in the $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ matrices were set to zero.
Within this approximation, the transition energy is just the difference between 
the ground state energy of the orbital an electron has been excited to($\epsilon_{\text{e}}$)
and the orbital has been excited from ($\epsilon_{\text{g}}$),

\begin{equation}
\Delta E = \epsilon_{\text{e}} - \epsilon_{\text{g}}
\end{equation}
%
. Additionally, transition properties can be calculated by constructing transition 
density matrices from the ground state orbitals such that needing only a single 
SCF optimization is required. Generally, eigenvalue difference methods are not 
seen as accurate response methods, but can offer a quick and easy initial value 
\cite{Gimon2009}.

\subsection{Transition Density and Dipole Moments}
\label{subsec:dscf_transition_density}
\dscf transition properties, such as the transition dipole moment, can be calculated from
the SCF solutions for the ground and excited states. The reduced one-particle transition
density matrix $\mathbf{D}^{21}$ can be written as

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{D}^{21} = \ket{\Psi_1} \bra{\Psi_2}
\end{equation}
%
where $\ket{\Psi_n}$ is the Slater determinant of state $n$, constructed from the
set of spin orbitals $\{ \phi_{j}^{\left(n\right)} \} $. Expressed 
in terms of the molecular orbitals coefficients $\mathbf{C}^{\left(n\right)}$, the
transition density matrix is

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{D}^{21} = \mathbf{C}^{\left(2\right)} \text{adj}\left(\mathbf{S}^{21}\right) \mathbf{C}^{\left(1\right) \dagger}
\end{equation}
%
where $\mathbf{S}^{21}$ is an overlap matrix with elements 

\begin{equation}
S^{21}_{jk} = \braket{\phi^2_j|\phi^1_k}
\end{equation}
%
. The depednece on the adjunct of the overlap
can be understood using L{\"o}wdin's normal rules for non-orthogonal determinants \cite{Lowdin1955}.
In the same way, the transition dipole moment is given by

\begin{equation}
\braket{\Psi_2|\hat{\mathbf{\mu}}|\Psi_1} = \sum_{jk} \mathbf{\mu}_{jk}^{21} \text{adj} \left( \mathbf{S}^{21}\right)_{jk}
\end{equation}
%
where $\hat{\mathbf{\mu}}$ is the one-electron transition dipole operator, and
$\mu_{jk}$ is the element of this operator corresponding to orbital indices $j$, $k$.
The determinant of $\mathbf{S^{21}}$ can be defined as the inner product of the 
two states involved in the transition

\begin{equation}
\left\lvert {\mathbf{S}^{21}} \right\rvert = \braket{\Psi_2|\Psi_1}
\end{equation}

The general definition of the transition dipole

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{\mu}^{1\rightarrow2} = \braket{\Psi_2|\hat{\mathbf{\mu}}|\Psi_1}
\end{equation}

can be expressed with this transition density matrix as:

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}    
\braket{\Psi_2|\hat{\mathbf{\mu}}|\Psi_1} &= \text{tr}\left(\hat{\mathbf{\mu}} \ket{\Psi_1} \bra{\Psi_2} \right) \\
&= \text{tr}\left( \hat{\mathbf{\mu}} \mathbf{D}^{21}\right)
\end{split}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Excitation Energy Transfer and Frenkel Hamiltonians}
\label{subsec:frenkel_exciton_theory}

Excitation energy transfer (EET) stabilizes the absorption of a photon of light,
and it is thought that light harvesting systems have evolved to maximize this stability\cite{Cleary2013}.
In regimes with strong couling (ie large transfer), excitation energy can flow back
and forth between different states, leading to a superposition. More explicitly,
transfer can be described as the transition from an initial state to a final state

\begin{equation}
\ce{D^* + A -> D + A^*}
\end{equation}

where $D$ and $A$ are the donor and acceptor system respectively, and $*$ denotes
the excited state. The superposition state can be given by the linear combination 
of the inital and final states:

\begin{equation}
\ket{\phi} = c_1 \ket{D^*A} + c_2 \ket{DA^*}
\end{equation}

where $c_n$ are the cofficients of each acceptor-donor state. We can write the total
electronic Hamiltonian for an aggregate of chromophore molecule sites as a sum of
individual site Hamiltonians and cross site interactions

\begin{equation}
\hat{H}_{\text{tot}} = \sum^N_m \hat{H}_m + \sum^N_m \sum^N_n \left(\hat{V}_{\text{el-el}} + \hat{V}_{\text{el-nuc}} + \hat{V}_{\text{nuc-nuc}}\right)
\end{equation}

where $N$ is the number of sites, $\hat{H}_m$ is on-site Hamiltonian (ie only treats
electrons for the site $m$). $\hat{V}_{\text{el-el}}$, $\hat{V}_{\text{el-nuc}}$ 
and $\hat{V}_{\text{nuc-nuc}}$ are the electron-electron, electron-nuclear and nuclear-nuclear
interactions between two sites respectively. It is assumed that different site Hamiltonians
can give both the ground and excited states of the chromophore $m$, i.e. it satisfies
the time-independent Schr√∂dinger equation

\begin{equation}
\hat{H}_{a_m} \ket{\phi_{a_m}} = E_{a_m} \ket{\phi_{a_m}}
\end{equation}

where ${a_m}$ is the index of either the ground or an excited state for the chromophore
$m$. There are then three approximations we can make to simplify the total Hamiltonian.
First is to assume that there is only one site excitation, and this is to the first
excited state. This reduces the complexity of any solution to the total Hamiltonian,
and is known as the Heitler-London approximation\cite{Agranovich2000}. Second is 
that the chromophore sites are well separated enough that the wavefunctions do not
overlap\cite{Frenkel1931}. We can then use a Hartree product to construct the aggregate
wavefunctions from a basis set of individual chromophores

\begin{equation}
\ket{\Psi_\text{tot}} = \sum_{a_m} c_{a_m} \ket{\Phi_{a_m}}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\ket{\Phi_a} = \prod^N_m \phi_{a_m}
\end{equation}

where $c_{a_m}$ are the coefficients for each site, given from the eigenvectors 
of the time-independent Schr√∂diner equation. $\ket{\Phi_{a_m}}$ is the total chromophore
state, and $\phi_{a_m}$ are the one-electron orbitals on the chromophore site $m$.
The third approximation is to neglect the nuclear-electron and nuclear-nuclear interactions.
This can be done if the effects of the surrounding nuclear environment are treated
in the individual site Hamiltonians\cite{Scholes2003} - this includes the other 
chromophore sites as well as any other environments ie. the LH2 protein environment.
Alternatively, this term can just be ignored.

The total Hamiltonian can then just be expressed as the site Hamiltonians and an 
electronic coupling element between two sites. We then need to construct the total
Hamiltonian from the basis of single chromophores. Starting from the excitonic wavefunctions,
we can write

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\bra{\Phi_a} \hat{H}_{\text{tot}}\ket{\Phi_b} &= \sum^N_m \bra{\Phi_a} \hat{H}_{m}\ket{\Phi_b} + \sum^N_m \sum^N_n \bra{\Phi_a} \hat{V}_{\text{el-el}}\ket{\Phi_b} \\
&= E^{\left(m\right)}_{a_m} \prod^N_l \delta_{al} \delta_{bl} + \sum^N_m \sum^N_n \bra{\Phi_a} \hat{V}_{\text{el-el}}\ket{\Phi_b}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

where the first term are the site energies, as the exciton states are orthogonal. 
The second term needs to be expanded into the basis set of individual chromophore 
sites, so we can calculate this term from individual response calculations. Each 
term in the double summation can be given as

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\bra{\Phi_a} \hat{V}_{\text{el-el}}\ket{\Phi_b} &= \sum_{i \in \mathbf{r}_m} \sum_{j \in \mathbf{r}_n} \bra{\Phi_a} \frac{1}{\left|\mathbf{r_i} - \mathbf{r_j}\right|} \ket{\Phi_b} \\
&= \left(\sum_{i \in m} \sum_{j \in n} \bra{\phi^{\left(m\right)}_{a_m} \phi^{\left(n\right)}_{a_n}} \frac{1}{\left|\mathbf{r_i} - \mathbf{r_j}\right|} \ket{\phi^{\left(m\right)}_{b_m}\phi^{\left(n\right)}_{b_n}}\right)\prod^N_{l\neq m,n}\delta_{a_l, b_l}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

where $i,j$ are the indices of electrons on the sites $m,n$, and $\mathbf{r}_i, 
\mathbf{r}_j$ are their positions. With a few extra steps not included for brevity,
this expression can then be written in terms of the transition densities of each 
site\cite{Scholes2003}

\begin{equation}
\bra{\Phi_a} \hat{V}_{\text{el-el}}\ket{\Phi_b} = \int d\mathbf{r}_{m} \int d\mathbf{r}_{n} \frac{\rho_{a_m}\left(\mathbf{r}_{m}\right)\rho_{b_n}\left(\mathbf{r}_{n}\right)}{\left|\mathbf{r}_{m} - \mathbf{r}_{n}\right|}
\end{equation}

where $\rho_{a_m}$ is the transition density of transition $a$ on site $m$. These 
transition densities can be expanded in terms of multipoles, leading to dipole-dipole 
interactions methods. Taking all of the approximations into account, and simplifying 
some terms, we can then write the effective Hamiltonian that is used to describe 
Frenkel excitons as

\begin{equation}
\hat{H}_{\text{eff}} = \sum^N_{m=1} \epsilon_m + \sum^{N,N}_{m \neq n} J_{mn}
\end{equation}

where the diagonal elements $\epsilon_m$ are site energies of the chromophores, 
and the off-diagonal elements $J_{mn}$ are the coulombic coupling between the tranisiton
density of different sites. Calculating these coupling elements is discussed later
in more detail, but it is usual to take expand this term into a multipole expansion\cite{Steinmann2015}. 
The first term, corresponding to monopoles, is zero as a local excitation will not 
produce an overall transition charge (as opposed to a non-local charge-transfer 
excitation, which can be included in the Frenkel Hamiltonian in some cases\cite{Li2017}). 
The next term is a dipole-dipole interaction, and usually the expansion is stopped 
here. Hence, all that is needed to calculate a rough Frenkel exciton Hamiltonian 
is the local excitations and transition dipoles for each site. This can be done 
with many response methods, such as time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) 
or mean-field methods like \dscf.
