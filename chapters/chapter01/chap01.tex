\initial {N}aturally occuring light harvesting systems present an interesting 
scientific challenge. With near perfect efficiency, the energy from a photon
will be taken and transfered to a reaction centre, leading to charge transfer 
processes that culminate in powering biological systems. Making models that 
can predict and explain these effects are key to making similarly efficient 
photovoltaic systems.
