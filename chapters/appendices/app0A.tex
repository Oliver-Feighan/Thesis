\chapter{Appendix A}
\label{app:app01}

\initial{T}his appendix covers the common computational details of this work.
Included are the software packages, hardware used. These are not 
exhaustive list, and additional details are provided in the main chapters. However,
wherever implementations or methodology details are missing, the information will
be found here.

\section{Electronic Structure Codes}
This project has primarily used the \code{QCORE} software that is found as part
of the \code{ENTOS} project. This is a software package for DFT and DFTB electronic
structure calculations that has been written as a joint venture between the Miller
group in California Institute of Technology and the Manby group in the 
University of Bristol. It is now being hosted by Entos Inc. It is a novel C++
implementation, with a focus on modularity, functional code and modern development
practices to enable easier, cleaner and more reuseable code.
All novel methods discussed in the chapters have been implemented in the \code{QCORE} 
package.
